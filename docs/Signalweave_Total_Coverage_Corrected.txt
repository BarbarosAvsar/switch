3.1 Candidate A -- "Signalweave"
A) Identity
- Title: Signalweave
- Genre: strategic pattern-builder with social deduction and rhythm tactics
- Moment-to-moment (200-300 words):
Each round starts by drafting three motif cards and secretly choosing a role tile that grants a one-round action power. Everyone reveals simultaneously, then a sealed-bid auction sets priority for scarce Prime Nodes. On your sequential turn you spend Action Points to move your Weaver, place a motif tile, harvest resources, or claim nodes. Placements must respect adjacency rules and aim to complete visible pattern goals: symmetry rings, color sets, or rhythm chains. Completing a pattern opens a short performance window: hit the beat to lock for safe Resonance or press-your-luck to overcharge for a bigger payout at the risk of Dissonance. You weigh immediate score against engine building by investing in amplifiers that upgrade future placements. You watch opponents' board shapes, hand sizes, and bid behavior to infer hidden objectives, then decide to trade, bluff, or veto in the Council phase. In mixed modes you may cooperate to close a global Rift timer while still competing for personal Prestige. Each round ends with an Entropy pulse that erodes weak shapes, forcing defensive placement and adaptive planning. Visual cues highlight legal moves and threat paths; music swells to mark timing windows and tension. Every decision trades safety vs risk, solo gain vs group survival, and short-term gains vs long-term tempo.
- Unmistakable signature:
  - Dual phase: hidden simultaneous planning plus sequential execution
  - Pattern-lock rhythm windows tied to musical cues
  - Grid-based symmetry goals using shape language
  - Social contract phase with votes, bargaining, and sanctions
  - Adaptive Flow Director that tunes challenge without manual difficulty
B) Core Mechanic Spec (precise, rules-first)
- Rules: inputs -> states -> outputs
- Inputs: stick/d-pad move, A place tile, B harvest, Y trade, L/R bid, ZL/ZR select role, X press-your-luck, timing taps for lock.
- States: Planning (hidden selection), Auction, Action (AP), Conflict, Performance (timed lock), Council (vote), Entropy (system turn).
- Outputs: tile placement, resource changes, pattern completion, score, status effects, music state shifts.
- Info shown/hidden/delayed/noisy and why:
  - Hidden: role tiles, private objectives, hand order to enable imperfect information and signaling (GT-044, GT-051).
  - Shown: board, public goals, resources, bid outcomes to protect fairness and trust (GP-027, GT-037).
  - Delayed: Entropy target preview shown 1 turn ahead to reward planning (GT-005).
  - Noisy: partial visual/audio hints about rival objectives to sustain uncertainty and mixed strategies (GT-021, GT-062).
  Evidence: PDF-02 p.8 "Perfect vs Imperfect Information"; PDF-02 p.8 "Bayesian Nash"; PDF-01 p.8 "toxic... cheating... imbalance"; PDF-02 p.1 "Turn-Taking (Sequential)"; PDF-02 p.3 "Bluffing and Deception"

Worked examples
1) Beginner scenario
- Goal: complete a 3-tile symmetry ring.
- Decisions: place a rounded tile now or harvest a resource for a safer next turn.
- Uncertainty/strategy tension: low; focus is learning the rule.
- Perception: symmetry outline glows and the beat bar pulses; the glow shows the target, the pulse times the lock (VIS-013, MUS-008).

- Decisions: bid high now or shade the bid and negotiate a trade.
- Uncertainty/strategy tension: bids are hidden; risk of overpay and social betrayal (GT-012, GT-013, GT-011).
- Perception: bid timer uses high-contrast text and a rising ostinato signals closing time (VIS-022, MUS-019).

Principle IDs: GT-010, GT-016, GP-030, GT-038, MUS-019. Evidence: PDF-02 p.2 "Resource Management"; PDF-02 p.2-3 "Engine Building"; PDF-01 p.9 "short-term and long-term goals"; PDF-02 p.6 "catch-up mechanics"; PDF-04 p.7 "prediction error"
- Session loop (1-3h): choice = cooperate on Rift or race prestige; learning = repeated-game reading; feedback = council outcomes and public logs; failure/recovery = shared Rift reset with visible cost; tension-release = crisis state then resolution theme. Principle IDs: GT-060, GP-033, GP-027, MUS-028. Evidence: PDF-02 p.12 "Signaling Hidden traitor or role mechanics ... games of incomplete information"; PDF-01 p.10 "psychological pacing: periods of challenge (tension) followed by reward or rest (relief)"; PDF-01 p.8 "toxic... cheating... imbalance"; PDF-04 p.10 "reward pathway"
- Long-term mastery: choice = optimize deck and timing skill; learning = new motifs and advanced patterns; feedback = mastery tiers and fiero badges; failure/recovery = safe queue with slower tempo; tension-release = climax motifs on mastery wins. Principle IDs: GP-016, GP-030, MUS-029, MUS-027. Evidence: PDF-01 p.3 "fiero... pride"; PDF-01 p.9 "short-term and long-term goals"; PDF-04 p.11 "The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure crucial for memory, is engaged by music"; PDF-04 p.10 "the motor system entrains to rhythms"
D) Strategic & Incentive Structure (Game Theory binding)
- Core strategic shape: mixed cooperative/competitive repeated game with simultaneous planning, sequential execution, imperfect information, bargaining, and signaling pressures (GT-005, GT-006, GT-044, GT-051, GT-060).
- Degenerate strategy prevention: rotating incentives, capped engines, transparent payoffs, and anti-dominance checks; fairness preserved by visible probabilities and sanction tokens (GT-040, GT-050, GP-027).
- Strategy stories:
  1) "Rhythm banker": plays low-variance symmetry sets and times locks for steady payoff.
  2) "Signal bluff": uses noisy intent cues to secure trades at discount.
  3) "Rift closer": invests in co-op wins early, then pivots to prestige.
  Evidence: PDF-02 p.1 "Turn-Taking (Sequential)"; PDF-02 p.8 "Perfect vs Imperfect Information"; PDF-02 p.8 "Bayesian Nash"; PDF-02 p.12 "Signaling Hidden traitor or role mechanics ... games of incomplete information"; PDF-02 p.6-7 "players... strategies... payoffs"; PDF-02 p.8 "subgame-perfect"; PDF-01 p.8 "toxic... cheating... imbalance"

Creatives and engineers who design visual experiences often implicitly use these principles"
F) Music & Audio Binding
- Adaptive audio model: state machine (Calm -> Build -> Contest -> Crisis -> Triumph) with tempo, harmony, and timbre shifts.
- Tension-release mapping: contest raises tempo and dissonance; triumph resolves to consonant cadence (MUS-019, MUS-028).
- Entrainment/timing mapping: lock windows align to stable beat pulses and motor coupling (MUS-008, MUS-027).
- Memory hooks: faction motifs recur on key actions to build familiarity (MUS-029, MUS-017).
- 8 functional audio cues (meaning / anti-fatigue / principles):

  2) Auction close: rising sweep / randomized end tone / MUS-019.
  3) Rift warning: low pulse / fades after acknowledgement / MUS-027.
  4) Trade accepted: warm chord / limited repetition per round / MUS-028.
  5) Vote passed: unison hit / rotates instrumentation / MUS-021.
  6) Press-your-luck risk: dissonant tick / dynamic mix dip to avoid fatigue / MUS-019.
  7) Betrayal reveal: sharp stinger / cooldown timer / MUS-010.
  8) Victory fanfare: short motif / theme variants per win type / MUS-029.
  Evidence: PDF-04 p.3 "rhythm... motor system"; PDF-04 p.3 "timbre"; PDF-04 p.7 "prediction error"; PDF-04 p.10 "the motor system entrains to rhythms"; PDF-04 p.10 "reward pathway"; PDF-04 p.7-8 "preferences continue to be shaped by exposure, repetition, and social context"; PDF-04 p.11 "The hippocampus, a medial temporal lobe structure crucial for memory, is engaged by music"; PDF-04 p.5 "In adulthood, musical preferences tend to remain relatively stable, but they can still evolve"
G) Automatic Skill Adaptation & Fairness (PDF-justified)
- Skill model: timing accuracy, decision time, success rate, and cooperation ratio (GP-005, MUS-008).
- Adapts: timing window width, Entropy pressure, info clarity, and resource scarcity (GP-029, VIS-022, GT-038).
- Guardrails: transparent Stability Index, no hidden nerfs, player opt-in for pacing aids to preserve autonomy (GP-003).
- Fairness policy: skill-based matchmaking, visible catch-up tokens, anti-cheat logs; perceived fairness via explicit odds and outcome explanations (GP-027, GT-040).

H) Candidate Coverage Proof
- Covered Principle IDs: 182/182 (all).
- Weakly embodied: MUS-052/053 (anhedonia/amusia) -> strengthen with redundant visual timing cues and optional audio scaling (MUS-052, MUS-053). Evidence: PDF-04 p.26 "musical anhedonia"; PDF-04 p.27 "congenital amusia"

3.1 Candidate B -- "Veil Chorus"
A) Identity
- Title: Veil Chorus
- Genre: social deduction strategy with cooperative rhythm missions and policy voting
- Moment-to-moment (200-300 words):
Each round opens with a public mission briefing and a hidden loyalty card for each player (Chorus or Veil). You secretly choose a stance card (Support, Delay, or Probe) and assign effort tokens to one of three rhythm tasks. Everyone reveals simultaneously, then you perform a short rhythm pattern; the shared success meter rises only if enough support tokens and accurate timing occur. After the mission, a Council phase begins: players propose policies (tempo changes, resource taxes, investigation powers) and vote via secret ballots or open votes depending on the policy. You can bargain, trade resources, and trade information, but hidden loyalties make every promise suspect. Failed missions spawn evidence tokens that provide partial clues about roles; these clues are noisy and can be manipulated with influence. Over the session you build a small engine of role perks and public trust levels, deciding whether to invest in cooperation, probe others, or exploit a moment for personal advantage. Visual alerts mark suspicion and time limits; music cues shift between unity and discord. Decisions constantly balance personal secrecy with group survival, and each vote can swing the narrative from harmony to collapse.
- Unmistakable signature:
  - Rhythm missions that require co-op timing and shared entrainment
  - Hidden loyalty system with noisy evidence and signaling
  - Council phase with voting, bargaining, and policy auctions
  - Public trust meter that shapes incentives and pacing
  - Adaptive tempo and mission complexity based on group performance
B) Core Mechanic Spec (precise, rules-first)

- Inputs: stick/d-pad select stance, A confirm, B cancel, L/R allocate effort, ZL/ZR vote, timing taps during missions.
- States: Briefing, Planning (hidden stance), Mission (rhythm task), Council (vote), Trade, Resolve.
- Outputs: mission success/fail, trust shifts, resource changes, evidence tokens, music state shifts.
- Info shown/hidden/delayed/noisy and why:
  - Hidden: loyalties and stance cards to create imperfect information and signaling (GT-044, GT-051).
  - Shown: mission difficulty, trust meter, public votes to protect fairness (GP-027, GT-037).
  - Delayed: evidence tokens revealed after mission to reward sustained cooperation (GT-060).
  - Noisy: evidence tokens are probabilistic to sustain mixed strategies (GT-062).
  Evidence: PDF-02 p.8 "Perfect vs Imperfect Information"; PDF-02 p.8 "Bayesian Nash"; PDF-01 p.8 "toxic... cheating... imbalance"; PDF-02 p.12 "Signaling Hidden traitor or role mechanics ... games of incomplete information"; PDF-02 p.13 "alliances/betrayal"

- Audio/music guidance (PDF-04):
  - Entrainment pulses for mission timing, prediction cues for vote outcomes, and motif recall for trust states (MUS-008, MUS-019, MUS-029).

2) Intermediate scenario
- Goal: pass a policy vote without revealing your loyalty.
- Decisions: vote openly to build trust or vote secretly to hide intent.
- Uncertainty/strategy tension: signaling vs deception in a repeated game (GT-033, GT-051, GT-060).
- Perception: vote options grouped with high-contrast selection states (VIS-010, VIS-022); tension motif rises (MUS-019).

3) Mastery scenario
- Goal: coordinate a Stag Hunt mission while a suspected Veil player tempts defection.
- Decisions: commit to co-op timing or defect for personal gain; choose a public signal.
- Uncertainty/strategy tension: coordination under possible betrayal (GT-056, GT-060, GT-051).

3.1 Candidate C -- "Mythic Circuit"
A) Identity
- Title: Mythic Circuit
- Genre: narrative deck-builder with spatial exploration and tactical duels
- Moment-to-moment (200-300 words):
You enter each chapter by drafting a small starting deck and choosing a hero role. A tile bag contains terrain tiles and event nodes; on your turn you place a tile adjacent to the path, move your hero along it, and trigger the node. Nodes can be peaceful camps, puzzles, or duels. In camps you spend resources to draft new cards, convert resources, or upgrade a card, building an engine for later chapters. Duels are zero-sum skirmishes played with hand management: you choose one card to play face up and one face down, creating a mixed-strategy bluff. Narrative choices appear at key nodes, forcing you to trade immediate power for long-term advantages. Exploration is partially shared: in social mode, players compete for relics but must cooperate to close a shared threat track. The map evolves, so spatial choices change future opportunities. Visual cues mark safe routes and high-risk nodes; music shifts from wandering motifs to intense duel patterns as tension rises. Each decision weighs deck growth vs immediate survival, exploration vs combat, and solo gains vs shared objectives.
- Unmistakable signature:
  - Tile placement exploration that reshapes the path
  - Deck and bag building with visible engine upgrades
  - Zero-sum duels with hidden card selection
  - Narrative choices with tangible mechanical tradeoffs
  - Adaptive pacing for kids-to-experts without manual settings
B) Core Mechanic Spec (precise, rules-first)
- Rules: inputs -> states -> outputs
- Inputs: stick/d-pad move, A place tile, B open node, X play card, L/R cycle hand, ZL/ZR select narrative choice.
- States: Exploration, Node Resolve, Draft/Upgrade, Duel, Threat Phase.
- Outputs: map expansion, resource gain/loss, deck changes, duel outcomes, music state shifts.
- Info shown/hidden/delayed/noisy and why:
  - Hidden: face-down duel card and future node order to create imperfect information (GT-044).
  - Shown: path, current threats, resource costs to protect fairness and planning (GP-027, GT-037).
  - Delayed: relic benefits revealed after chapter to reward long-term strategy (GT-060).
  - Noisy: some exploration outcomes are probabilistic to sustain mixed strategies (GT-062).

- Fairness policy: skill-based matchmaking, transparent catch-up items, anti-cheat monitoring.
- Perceived fairness: show why outcomes happened (clear logs, probabilities), provide rematch.
- Anti-toxicity: limited chat to positive presets; report tools; reward sportsmanship.

5.7 Vision + UI Bible (deep)
- Palette logic: warm hues signal threat and urgency; cool hues signal safety and recovery (VIS-009). Preserve color constancy and avoid misleading context shifts (VIS-006).
- Contrast and edge: critical text uses high contrast and clear edge definition (VIS-022).
- Attention hierarchy: motion and size pull attention for urgent elements while top-down goals stay visible (VIS-021, VIS-023).
- Gestalt grouping: proximity, similarity, continuity, and closure group related UI panels (VIS-010).
- Figure-ground: strong separation between interactable tiles and background (VIS-011).
- Cognitive load rules: limit concurrent elements, keep iconography consistent, and chunk by function (VIS-020).
- 12 UI layouts (what must be seen first and how):
  1) Main Board: Rift Timer first via warm color + motion (VIS-009, VIS-023).
  2) Hand/Role: Active role first via size and proximity grouping (VIS-010).
  3) Auction: Bid cap first via high-contrast numerals (VIS-022).
  4) Council Vote: Options group first via similarity and closure (VIS-010).
  5) Performance: Beat bar first via motion and center placement (VIS-023).
  6) Conflict: Opponent threat first via angular shape and contrast (VIS-012, VIS-022).
  7) Trade: Offer group first via proximity and grouping borders (VIS-010).
  8) Progress: Next goal first via contrast and symmetry highlight (VIS-013, VIS-022).
  9) Map Overlay: Threat path first via warm color and continuity (VIS-009, VIS-010).
  10) Settings: Accessibility toggles first via contrast and grouping (VIS-022, VIS-010).
  11) Results: Fiero badge first via symmetry glow and figure-ground separation (VIS-013, VIS-011).
  12) Tutorial: Step card first via size and isolated figure-ground (VIS-011).

5.8 Music + Audio Bible (deep, rule-based)
- Pitch/timbre/rhythm identity: each faction uses a distinct timbre and interval motif; timbre anchors source recognition and emotion (MUS-010).
- Entrainment rules: action windows align to stable beat pulses; tempo scales to player skill (MUS-008, MUS-027).
- Prediction/surprise mapping: music sets expectations, then small deviations add tension (MUS-019).
- Tension-release mapping: contest states increase dissonance and tempo; success resolves to consonant cadence (MUS-028).
- Adaptive music state machine: Calm -> Build -> Contest -> Crisis -> Triumph with explicit transition rules.
- Functional audio glossary with fatigue prevention:
  1) Lock window = short bell on beat / timbre variants to avoid fatigue / MUS-008, MUS-010.
  2) Auction close = rising sweep / randomized end tone / MUS-019.
  3) Rift warning = low pulse / fade after acknowledgement / MUS-027.
  4) Trade accepted = warm chord / rate-limited per round / MUS-028.
  5) Vote passed = unison hit / rotating instrumentation / MUS-021.
  6) Press-your-luck risk = dissonant tick / dynamic mix dip / MUS-019.
  7) Betrayal reveal = sharp stinger / cooldown timer / MUS-010.
  8) Victory fanfare = short motif / theme variants / MUS-029.
- Repetition/fatigue prevention: motif rotation, layered variations, and silence breaks (MUS-020).
