Human Vision and the Psychology Behind It
Introduction
Human vision is not just a camera-like recording of the world – it is an active process involving our
eyes, brain, and mind working together . We sense light through the eyes, but we perceive and interpret
what we see using psychological processes shaped by evolution, development, and experience. From
the colors and shapes we favor to the emotions visuals evoke, understanding human vision requires
insights from biology, neuroscience, psychology, and even art and design. Below, we explore how we
perceive colors and shapes, how our brain builds visual references, why we like (or dislike) certain
visuals, and how seeing is intertwined with thinking and feeling.
Anatomy of the Eye and Visual Processing
Figure: Diagram of the human eye (horizontal section). Light enters through the  cornea and pupil,
passes through the lens, and projects onto the  retina at the back of the eye. Key structures like the
fovea (central  pit)  and  optic  nerve are  labeled.  The  retina’s  photoreceptor  cells  (cones  and  rods)
transduce light into neural signals for the brain to process. 
Human vision begins with the  eyes focusing light onto the retina, which is a layered sheet of light-
sensitive cells. The cornea and lens at the front of the eye bend incoming light to focus images onto the
fovea (the central part of the retina with highest acuity). Photoreceptors in the retina capture
the light:  cones (concentrated in the fovea) work best in bright light and give us  sharp, detailed color
vision, while  rods (more numerous in the periphery of the retina) are very light-sensitive and enable
night and motion vision at the cost of detail and color . In bright conditions our vision is cone-dominated
(high resolution and color), whereas in a dark room rods take over – which is why in dim light we mostly
see shades of gray and less detail. The signals from rods and cones are passed through retinal
neurons to the ganglion cells, whose axons bundle to form the optic nerve carrying visual information

into  the  brain .  Notably,  where  the  optic  nerve  exits  the  eye  there  are  no  photoreceptors,
creating a blind spot – yet we normally don’t notice it, because each eye covers for the other and the
brain “fills in” the missing information automatically.
In the brain, the optic nerves meet at the optic chiasm (an X-shaped junction) where the nerve fibers
partially cross. This routing sends information from the left visual field to the right side of the brain and
vice versa . Visual signals then travel to the  occipital lobe at the back of the brain, where the
primary visual cortex and other areas process the raw input into meaningful perception. The brain
handles these signals along two major pathways in parallel: the “what” pathway (ventral stream) and
the “where/how” pathway (dorsal stream). The “what” pathway (into the temporal lobe) recognizes
objects – determining what you are looking at – and the “where/how” pathway (into the parietal lobe)
computes where things are in space and how to interact with them. For example, when you see a
ball: the ventral stream identifies it as a ball (and its color , shape, etc.), while the dorsal stream figures
out that it’s moving toward the left and that you could reach out to catch it. These two streams show
how vision is deeply integrated with cognition and action – our brain is simultaneously recognizing
the world and preparing responses.
Another remarkable aspect of early vision processing is that the brain isn’t a passive receiver of visual
data; it actively transforms signals for usefulness. A clear example is the automatic compensation for
lighting conditions. The brain uses  context to maintain  color constancy and  brightness constancy: we
perceive  an  object’s  color  or  shade  as  stable  under  varying  lighting.  A  famous  optical  illusion
demonstrates this: two squares on a checkered board, one in bright light and one in a shadow, can be
physically the same gray shade yet one looks much lighter than the other because the brain expects the
shadowed one to be lighter in reality. In other words, our perceptual system factors in illumination
and  “corrects” our vision so that we usually see a white piece of paper as white whether it’s under
noon sun or in shade – a useful trick, but one that illusions exploit to fool us.
Figure:The checker shadow illusion – A and B are exactly the same shade of gray, but our vision
system insists that A looks darker than B. The brain, using context (the shadow cast by the cylinder and
the checkerboard pattern), unconsciously lightens the appearance of square B, assuming it is in shadow
and should be a “white” square. This illusion highlights how our perception is constructed by the brain
rather than a direct read-out of light intensity. The brain’s built-in knowledge of the world (that
surfaces in shadow are usually lighter than they look) leads to a compelling misperception here. Such

examples show that from the earliest stages, seeing is an active inference process – our brain is guessing
and adjusting what we see based on context and experience.
Perception of Color
How do we perceive the rich spectrum of colors? It starts with the cone photoreceptors in our eyes,
which come in three types, each tuned to different ranges of wavelengths (roughly sensitive to blue,
green, or red light) . According to the  trichromatic theory of color vision, any color can be
produced by combining the activity of these three cone types. For example, both yellow light and a
mix of red+green light stimulate the “red” and “green” cones similarly, so we perceive the same yellow
color .  However ,  our  color  perception  is  refined  further  by  the  brain  through  opponent-process
mechanisms: certain neurons and circuits treat pairs of colors as opposites –  red vs. green,  blue vs.
yellow, white vs. black. Signals from the cones are recombined so that some cells fire, for instance, for
“red” and are inhibited by “green.” This opponent coding explains why we don’t perceive a “reddish-
green” and why staring at a blue image can make a yellow afterimage appear – the neural opponent
channels  get  fatigued.  Together ,  trichromatic  input  and  opponent  processing  allow  the  brain  to
discriminate millions of hues in a consistent way.
Color perception is also profoundly psychological. The colors we see are interpreted in the brain to
have  consistent  appearance  under  different  lights  (color  constancy,  as  noted),  and  they  also  carry
emotional and associative meanings for us. Humans have noticeable  color preferences: studies have
found that people tend to love certain hues and dislike others  across cultures. A prominent finding is
that the color  blue is often the most favored color worldwide. One scientific explanation (called the
ecological valence theory) proposes that we grow to prefer colors strongly associated with pleasant or
survival-related things in our environment, and to shun colors tied to unpleasant things. For example,
blue and cyan tones remind us of clear skies and clean water – things that historically signaled good
weather and safe hydration – so we generally have positive feelings toward blue. In contrast, brownish
or olive-green tones often evoke rotting food, dirty water , or decay, which could explain why these
colors are less popular or even aversive. In one experiment, researchers found bright blues, reds, and
greens among the most liked colors, whereas a muddy brown and an olive green ranked near the
bottom. Notably, people’s experiences with colored objects influence their preferences: when a color is
strongly associated with things they love (say, the rich brown of chocolate or coffee), they may come to
appreciate that color more. In short, we like colors that remind us of good things and avoid colors
linked to bad things – a blend of biological predisposition and learned association.
Colors also have emotional impacts that designers and artists routinely leverage. Warm colors like red
and orange are often described as  energizing or attention-grabbing, whereas cool colors like blue and
green feel calming or refreshing. These effects are not merely cultural clichés; they stem in part from our
evolutionary and personal associations (fire and blood are dangerous or exciting – red gets the heart
pumping; the blue of twilight signals a time to relax, water and shade are cooling – blue soothes us). To
give one example, many social networks use a blue color scheme, possibly because people find blue
trustworthy and calming, while fast-food chains often use red or yellow accents to stimulate appetite
and a sense of urgency. Of course, individual reactions vary and context matters (a “calming” blue in a
fun toy might actually appear cold or sad in a different setting). But broadly, color psychology shows
that color can influence our mood and decisions unconsciously. We even use color in language to describe
emotions (feeling  blue, seeing  red,  green with envy), underscoring how deeply colors are intertwined
with our feelings.

Perception of Shapes and Forms
When it comes to shapes and patterns, the human visual system is extremely adept at finding structure
– we don’t just see patches of light and dark; we organize them into  meaningful forms. A group of
early  psychologists  known  as  the  Gestalt  psychologists discovered  that  the  brain  follows  certain
principles of organization automatically. They famously said  “the whole is different from the sum of its
parts,” meaning our perception of a complete form is not just putting together bits like a puzzle –
instead,  the  brain  tends  to  group  and  simplify visual  input  in  predictable  ways.  These  Gestalt
principles include: 
Figure-ground segregation: We intuitively separate a scene into a figure (the object of focus)
and  ground (background).  Depending  on  what  we  consider  figure  vs.  background,  the
perception can completely flip. A classic example is Rubin’s vase illusion – it can be seen as a
white vase (with black background) or as two black faces in profile, alternately, but not both at
once. The visual system can usually only hold one interpretation as the “figure” at a time. 
Proximity: Elements that are close together are perceived as a group. If you see a cluster of dots
near each other and a separate cluster a bit away, you’ll naturally see two groups of dots, not
just a single collection.
Similarity: Objects that look similar (in color , shape, etc.) get grouped in our perception. For
instance, in a grid of alternating colored dots, we tend to perceive rows or columns of like colors
as units. This principle is why, say, players wearing the same jersey are instantly seen as one
team on a field.
Continuity (Good continuation): We prefer to see continuous lines and patterns rather than
disjointed fragments. If lines or edges appear to form a smooth path, we perceive them as part
of the same object or trajectory, even if they intersect or are broken. We’d see an X as two
crossing lines rather than >/< shapes meeting.
Closure: The brain tends to fill in missing pieces to see a complete object. If part of a shape is
missing, we still perceive the whole by mentally closing the gaps. For example, a circle drawn
with a small break in the outline is still seen as a circle, not two separate arcs – our mind closes
the circle.
These grouping rules operate so automatically that we often have to  unlearn them to understand
abstract or camouflaged images. They reflect how the visual system evolved to make quick sense of the
environment – imposing structure and meaning efficiently.

Figure:Figure–ground optical illusion (Rubin’s Vase) – Are you looking at a vase or two faces? In this
classic ambiguous image, the brain can interpret the shapes in two ways: either the light-colored vase
shape in the center is the “figure” against a dark background, or the dark profiles on either side are the
figures facing each other with a light background. Our perception flips between these interpretations,
illustrating how the brain actively organizes visual input into figure and ground. This demonstrates a
basic  step  of  shape  perception  –  deciding  what in  the  scene  is  the  object  of  interest  and  what  is
backdrop. Once the figure-ground decision is made, the other Gestalt principles help group the details
into coherent objects.
Beyond these general principles of how we perceive forms, an intriguing question is  why certain
shapes please us while others put us on edge. Humans across cultures seem to have some universal
aesthetic biases when it comes to basic shapes and contours. One well-documented phenomenon is a
preference for curved lines and shapes over sharp, angular ones. Experimental studies using abstract
shapes  have  consistently  found  that  people  judge  curvy,  rounded  forms  as  more  attractive  or
pleasant, whereas spiky or jagged forms feel more “angry” or threatening. Neuroscientists have even
observed that viewing sharp-angled patterns can trigger a slight fear or stress response – for example,
one study showed increased amygdala activation (the brain’s fear center) when people viewed objects
with  sharp  features,  suggesting  an  innate  caution.  Why  would  this  be  the  case?  Evolutionary
psychologists propose that in our ancestral environment,  sharp angles were often signs of danger
(think of teeth, thorns, or a snarling animal’s angular face), so being wary of jagged shapes had survival
value. Conversely, rounded shapes (like smooth berries or friendly human faces) typically signaled safe
or nourishing things. Research by Bar and Neta (2007) supports this: they found that people not only
prefer curved objects but also implicitly associate angular shapes with a sense of threat, as indicated by
both self-reports and amygdala activity. This “sharp = dangerous, round = safe” bias might be deeply
embedded. Indeed, even infants as young as a few months old look longer at curved shapes than at
angular  shapes,  hinting  that  the  preference  for  curves  emerges  very  early  (possibly  innate).  And
intriguingly, this isn’t just a Western or modern quirk – studies in non-Western cultures and even tests
with other primates have found similar preferences for curvature, pointing to a biological basis.
Another visual feature humans tend to love is symmetry. Symmetrical shapes and patterns (where one
side mirrors the other) are generally rated as more attractive and harmonious across many studies. This
holds true in abstract designs, art, and especially for faces and bodies – a symmetrical face is usually
deemed more beautiful or healthy-looking than an asymmetrical one. Evolutionary reasoning suggests
5

--- Page 6 ---
symmetry could be a proxy for genetic fitness or good development (since asymmetry might result
from  disease  or  injury),  thus  we’re  drawn  to  it  in  mates  and  even  in  the  things  we  create  (art,
architecture). Neuroscientifically, our brains also process symmetrical images more fluently; adults and
even infants detect symmetry quickly and remember symmetrical patterns better than random ones
. Symmetry provides a sense of order and balance that our visual system finds satisfying, perhaps
because it reduces perceptual complexity – the brain has to process only half and can predict the rest.
Interestingly, children don’t show a strong preference for symmetry until a certain age (around 5–9
years for faces), indicating that some appreciation might develop with cognitive maturation or learned
cultural values, even if the detection of symmetry is innate. Overall, we seem wired to enjoy symmetry
– it consistently appears in human aesthetics, from folk patterns to high art, and across eras people
have associated symmetry with beauty and even “truth” in nature.
Now, not all our shape preferences are inborn; many are shaped by personal and cultural experiences
too. For instance, some shapes might carry learned symbolism (a heart shape means love to us because
we’ve learned that association, though it’s not inherently “lovely” in nature). Our perception of forms is
also influenced by context and expectations. Recall the Gestalt idea of  closure – we fill in gaps.
Similarly,  our  brain  uses  “perceptual  hypotheses” to  interpret  ambiguous  shapes,  essentially  best
guesses based on what we’ve seen before. If you glimpse something coiled on a hiking trail, your brain
might instantly guess “snake!” if you’ve evolved with snakes or heard of them – and you might jump,
until closer inspection shows it’s a harmless rope. Our  visual system cross-references memory to
recognize objects: we have mental templates so strong that we often see things that aren’t there if they
resemble  familiar  patterns  (like  seeing  faces  in  clouds,  a  phenomenon  called  pareidolia).  These
tendencies highlight that what we perceive is a mix of incoming data and prior knowledge. We build
an internal library of references – basically, every new shape or object we encounter is compared
against what we already know. This is why a biologist sees much more in a pattern of leaves than a
layperson (their brain has more reference data for plants), or why one person might find an abstract
shape meaningless while an art expert sees intentional form. Our  expectations and mindset also
prime us to see shapes in certain ways: if you’re told to expect a hidden word in a jumble of shapes,
you’ll be more likely to “find” it by organizing the shapes accordingly. Psychologists call this perceptual
set, and it is influenced by factors like our personality, past experiences, and even current mood. In
short, we perceive shapes not just with our eyes but with our brain’s interpretations – balancing
raw sensory input with assumptions and knowledge. That is why illusions and Rorschach inkblots are so
intriguing: they play with that boundary between what’s on the page and what our mind brings to it.
Finally, tying back to preferences: “Why do we like what we like?” Some of it, as discussed, is rooted in
survival  (e.g.  avoid  pointy  things,  approach  symmetrical  healthy  things).  Some  is  about  ease  of
processing –  we  tend  to  prefer  visuals  that  our  brains  can  process  fluently  (a  concept  known  as
perceptual fluency). A symmetrical, high-contrast shape on a plain background is simply easier for the
visual system to digest than a chaotic, asymmetrical tangle, and this ease can translate into a positive
aesthetic feeling (“easy on the eyes”). Similarly, moderate complexity (like the repeating patterns of
leaves or the spirals of a seashell) is pleasing because it hits a sweet spot between simplicity and
boredom on one hand, and randomness and confusion on the other . Our brains like a bit of a puzzle –
enough  pattern  to  recognize,  but  also  a  bit  of  novelty.  That  may  explain  why  fractals (repeating
patterns at different scales, common in nature) are often found beautiful – think of snowflakes, or the
branching of trees.
Vision, Emotions, and the Brain’s Coordination
Seeing is an emotional and cognitive experience, not just a mechanical one. The  brain coordinates
vision with thinking and feeling at every moment. As visual information courses from the eyes to
12
12
6

--- Page 7 ---
various  brain  regions,  it  doesn’t  just  stop  in  the  visual  cortex.  It  spreads  to  memory  centers  and
emotional centers that together color our perceptions with meaning and significance.
One important player here is the amygdala, an almond-shaped part of the limbic system (the brain’s
emotional hub). The amygdala is known for processing emotions – especially fear and threat – and it is
tightly connected to our visual system. Imagine walking in the woods and suddenly seeing a snake-
like curve on the path: even before you fully identify it as a stick or snake, your amygdala has already
sprung into action, prompting a surge of caution or fear . This “quick and dirty” pathway (sometimes
called the low road) from the eyes to the amygdala allows us to react to potential threats in a split
second, possibly before we are even conscious of what we saw. In essence, the amygdala  adds an
emotional tag to visual inputs, flagging those that might be important for survival. For threatening
shapes (like the aforementioned sharp angles that could signify an angry face or a predator), the
amygdala’s  response  can  be  measured  as  heightened  activity,  and  it  can  even  influence  how  we
perceive those stimuli. Studies have shown that when emotional significance is involved, the amygdala
can increase activity in parts of the visual cortex (like the fusiform gyrus, which helps with recognizing
objects and faces) to  boost the chances that we consciously notice the emotionally relevant item. In
other words, if you’re in a state of fear , you might literally see differently – the brain is tuning your vision
to look for threats. This coordination ensures that vision isn’t just about mapping the world, but about
evaluating it: Is this thing good or bad? Dangerous or helpful?
Vision is also intertwined with  memory and thought. The moment we see something familiar – say,
your friend’s face or your favorite mug – our brain’s recognition systems (in the temporal lobe) connect
with memory networks to retrieve information about it (the friend’s name, the mug’s sentimental value,
etc.).  This  happens  so  seamlessly  that  we  don’t  realize  an  act  of  memory  just  occurred.  Our  past
experiences create a context for present vision. That is why a single image can make you suddenly
nostalgic or upset: the sight of an old photograph, for instance, might activate your hippocampus
(critical for memory) and bring back a flood of recollections. There’s also a concept called  embodied
perception – the idea that our current state (bodily and emotional) can influence how we perceive. If
you’re anxious, you might literally perceive a benign expression as a frown, or see the environment as
more threatening, due to top-down influence of your emotional state on vision. Psychological studies
confirm that things like biases, prejudices, and expectations can subtly skew perception. For example,
one study found that people were quicker to “see” a weapon in someone’s hand if the person was of a
stereotyped group, even when no weapon was present – a dangerous illusion created by expectation
and fear . This shows that thinking and feeling can literally change what we see. Our brain is not a neutral
observer; it’s an active participant that filters and interprets visual signals.
From a coordination standpoint, we can imagine the brain as having multiple layers of processing for
vision: a lower layer that does the basic parsing of lines, colors, movement (in occipital and parietal
regions),  and  higher  layers  that  attach  labels,  significance,  and  reactions  (in  temporal  lobe  for
identification, limbic system for emotion, frontal lobe for decision-making). These layers constantly
interact. If you see something emotionally charged – imagine the flag of a country, or the face of
someone you love – visual areas will feed into emotional circuits (making your heart race or giving you
warmth), and those emotions in turn can focus your attention or sharpen certain details of the image
for you. Neuroimaging studies have even found that emotional scenes (like seeing a frightening image)
can  cause  increased  activity  in  early  visual  cortex:  essentially,  your  brain  opens  its  eyes  wider for
emotionally important sights. At the same time, your frontal cortex (in charge of reasoning and self-
control) can modulate your vision and emotion – e.g. when you realize that “snake” is actually a stick,
your cortex dampens the amygdala’s alarm and your visual interpretation shifts to match reality.
In summary, vision, cognition, and emotion form a seamless loop. We do not simply see and then
separately feel – we feel as we see, and we think as we see. This integration is what allows, for instance, art
13
7

--- Page 8 ---
to move us so deeply: a painting or a film strikes our eyes, but its effect comes from how it resonates in
our mind and heart. Our brain coordinates these domains to produce the rich experience of sight:
recognizing  a  stimulus  (a  rose),  recalling  what  it  means  (roses  symbolize  love,  and  that  one  time
someone gave you a rose), and feeling something about it (joy or sadness, depending on the memory).
Vision is truly a whole-brain process, engaging neural circuits for perception, knowledge, and emotion
all at once.
Applications in Design and Aesthetics
Understanding human vision and its psychological underpinnings isn’t just academic – it has practical
applications in every field related to visuals, from graphic design and architecture to film production
and user-interface (UI) design. Creatives and engineers who design visual experiences often implicitly
use these principles to make their work more effective and appealing.
Take  production  design  in  film (the  crafting  of  a  movie’s  visual  environment)  –  color  and  shape
psychology guide many choices. Filmmakers use color palettes to set the mood of a scene (think of the
stark desaturated colors of a horror movie versus the warm, saturated tones of a romantic sunset
scene). They know that  color can subtly control audience emotion. For example, a surge of red
lighting can heighten tension or signal danger (playing on red’s association with alarm), whereas a wash
of blue can calm or evoke melancholy. Set designers also leverage  shape language in props and
scenery: a villain’s lair might feature jagged, angular architecture and spiky shapes, which intuitively feel
menacing, whereas a hero’s home might have more rounded, soft forms that feel safe. These choices
align with our earlier discussion that angular = threatening and curved = inviting. Indeed, in animation
and  character  design,  artists  rigorously  use  shape  psychology:  protagonists are  often  drawn  with
rounded,  soft  silhouettes to  appear  friendly  and  approachable,  while  antagonists get  angular  or
pointed features to signal danger and harshness. Disney animators, for instance, frequently give
heroes big doe eyes (round) and flowing curves in their outline, but villains get sharp cheekbones,
pointed chin, or triangular costumes – none of this is accidental. It’s a visual shorthand to tap into our
subconscious responses so that the audience feels a character’s personality at first sight.
Graphic designers and UI/UX designers apply Gestalt principles directly to make information clear and
pleasing.  When  designing  a  website  or  app  interface,  knowing  that  users  will  group  elements  by
proximity  and  similarity  is  crucial.  Spacing  out  unrelated  buttons  (to  obey  proximity)  and  using
consistent styles for related controls (to leverage similarity) helps users intuitively navigate. If you want a
user to see two things as distinct, you put space between them; if you want them seen as a unit, you
group them closely or give them a common color or shape. Figure-ground considerations are vital in
logo design – the FedEx logo, for example, famously uses figure-ground ambiguity to hide an arrow in
the negative space, a clever visual pun that also grabs attention once noticed. Artists often play with
closure, giving viewers just enough fragments of a shape so that our mind connects the dots (which
can be more engaging, as the audience “completes” the image mentally). Symmetry and patterns are
used in everything from corporate logos to building facades to create a sense of harmony (unless the
goal is to create tension or movement, in which case deliberate asymmetry might be used). 
In  architecture and environmental design, human vision research guides how spaces are lit and
colored. A well-lit, high-contrast environment can make a space feel open and safe (because our vision
works  well  and  nothing  hides  in  the  shadows),  whereas  dim,  monochromatic  lighting  can  create
intimacy or sometimes anxiety (exploiting our visual sensitivity to contrast). Casinos, for example, use
specific lighting and color choices to keep people alert and engaged, while hospitals choose soothing
colors  like  pale  blues  and  greens  to  calm  patients.  Marketing  and  advertising,  too,  lean  on  these
principles: brand colors are chosen to convey traits (blue for trustworthiness and competence – think
14
14 15

--- Page 9 ---
banks and tech companies; green for eco-friendliness or health; red for excitement and urgency – think
clearance sale signs) and package design uses shapes that appeal (e.g. a shampoo bottle with smooth
curves feels gentle, versus a cleaning solvent with a sharp angular bottle that looks potent and precise).
Even  safety  and  readability benefit  from  vision  science:  high-contrast  text  (black  on  yellow,  for
instance) is most quickly perceived, so warning signs adopt those combinations. Peripheral vision is
poor at detail but great at detecting motion, a fact used in automobile dashboard designs (important
signals are often accompanied by blinking lights or placed centrally). And knowing about the blind spot
(each eye’s visual field has a hole where the optic nerve is) is crucial in designing things like rear-view
mirrors or VR headsets, to ensure critical visuals aren’t lost where we literally cannot see.
All these examples boil down to this:  by aligning design with how human vision and psychology
naturally work, we create images and spaces that feel “right” to people. Good design either plays
to our expectations – creating visual comfort – or deliberately violates them in calculated ways to
surprise  or  provoke  thought.  The  best  artists  and  designers,  knowingly  or  not,  are  human-vision
experts: they use contrast to draw the eye, patterns to please it, and anomalies to spark curiosity. They
take into account that we have limited attention, so they use bold shapes or color pops to guide focus.
They consider that we interpret visuals emotionally, so they choose forms and palettes that resonate with
the intended tone.
In conclusion, human vision is a rich interplay of biology and psychology. We’ve seen how eyes and
brain cooperate to let us perceive colors, shapes, depth, and motion; how the brain uses rules and past
experiences to organize and sometimes mislead our perceptions; why we lean towards certain visual
aesthetics thanks to evolution and association; and how seeing something is never a purely visual act
but one entangled with thought and emotion. The fields of vision science, cognitive psychology, and
neuroaesthetics continue to uncover more about this remarkable sense. Every answer we find (“why do
we prefer curves?”) often leads to new questions (“are there situations where we might prefer angular
shapes, and why?”). But one thing is clear: to see is to interpret. Our reality is actively constructed in
our minds from photons and neurons, shaped by millions of years of survival and enriched by individual
life experiences. That is what makes human vision so endlessly fascinating – it is at once a precise
scientific process and a deeply personal, psychological experience. And by understanding it, we not only
answer theoretical questions but also gain insight into creating a world (or artwork, or product) that
connects with people’s eyes and minds in the most meaningful way.
