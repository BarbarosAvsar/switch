The Psychology of Why Humans Play Games
Games are a universal part of human life – from children playing make-believe to adults engaging in
video or board games. Modern psychology shows that playing games fulfills deep-seated psychological
needs and desires. Games are not mere pastimes; they tap into what motivates us, how we feel, and
even how we socialize. Below we explore why humans play games, what they enjoy (and dislike) about
them, the emotions games evoke, and what makes a great game from a psychological perspective –
with an eye towards insights useful in game design. While we focus on video and board games, these
principles apply to all forms of play.
Core Reasons Humans Play Games (Motivation)
Intrinsic enjoyment and psychological needs: One major reason we play is simply because games are
fun  and  satisfying.  Psychologists  Ryan  and  Deci’s  Self-Determination  Theory  (SDT) explains  that
humans are driven by innate needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness, and games excel at
satisfying all three. When a game makes us feel skilled and effective (competence), grants us freedom
and control (autonomy), and connects us with others (relatedness), it becomes deeply compelling. In
games, competence comes from mastering challenges and experiencing the focused state of  flow
(being “in the zone” at the right difficulty). Autonomy is present because we voluntarily choose to play
and  often  direct  our  own  in-game  decisions.  Relatedness  arises  when  games  let  us  interact  or
compete with others, forming social bonds in a fantasy context distinct from real life.
Achievement, social, and immersion motives: Another framework, by researcher Nick Yee, identifies
three  main  motivational  components  for  gamers:  achievement,  social,  and  immersion.  The
achievement motive drives people to advance, conquer goals, and compete – enjoying points, levels,
and victory over others. The social motive is the desire to form connections: many play games to chat,
cooperate, or be part of a team/community. Finally, immersion motivates players to enter a make-
believe world – crafting avatars, experiencing a story, and escaping real-life stresses for a while. For
example, a player might relish achievement by mastering difficult levels and topping leaderboards, seek
social fun by teaming up with friends in an online game, or enjoy immersion by role-playing in an epic
RPG storyline.
The fundamental need for play: Underlying all these is a basic human inclination toward play. From
an early age, play is how we learn, explore, and express creativity. Adults are no exception – games
provide a safe outlet for competition and imagination, a “permission” to be playful that can relieve
stress and boost happiness. In short, we play games to satisfy inner needs (feeling competent, in
control, connected) and because play itself is rewarding.

Different Types of Player Motivations
While humans share common needs,  not everyone enjoys games for the same reasons. In game
design, it’s helpful to consider different player types. A classic example is Richard Bartle’s taxonomy
for multiplayer games, which identifies: Achievers, Explorers, Socializers, and Killers. 
Achievers are driven by goals, points, and status. They want to win, collect rewards, and show off
accomplishments. (In Bartle’s analogy, they’re “diamonds” seeking treasure.) An Achiever in a
board game might be the one intensely playing to maximize score or win as quickly as possible. 
Explorers are curious and love discovery. They enjoy exploring the game world or mechanics,
finding secrets, and experimenting. (Bartle likens them to “spades” digging for information.) An
Explorer in a video game will wander off the beaten path to find hidden areas or easter eggs
rather than rush toward the end. 
Socializers play for the human element. They value interaction, teamwork, and friendship
through games. (Bartle tags them as “hearts,” empathetic and focused on others.) A Socializer
might prefer cooperative board games or online games where they can chat, role-play, or form
alliances, sometimes enjoying the socializing even more than the gameplay itself. 
Killers (a small subset of players) thrive on competition and impacting others directly. They enjoy
wielding power in the game, defeating or dominating other players – essentially the PvP-focused
folks (“clubs” that hit others, in Bartle’s terms). A Killer-type enjoys fighting games or competitive
shooters, and their fun comes from besting (and maybe trash-talking) opponents. Notably, 
Killers are rare compared to the other types – most players favor achieving, exploring, or
socializing over pure domination.
Most people are a mix of these motivations, but understanding them helps designers make games that
appeal to their target audience. For instance, a great multiplayer game often provides something for
each type: ranks and achievements for Achievers, rich worlds or mechanics for Explorers, chat and co-op
modes for Socializers, and fair competitive modes for the Killer-types. The key takeaway is that humans
play for varied reasons – a great game can either  specialize in one (e.g. a pure strategy game for
Achievers) or blend several to broaden its appeal.
What People Enjoy About Games
People love games because they deliver experiences and feelings that are hard to get in everyday life.
Here are some of the most cherished aspects of games and why they’re psychologically appealing,
with examples:
Fun  and  positive  emotions: At  a  basic  level,  games  are  enjoyable.  They  produce  hedonic
engagement – the pleasure of being actively involved in something purely for enjoyment. This
fun often comes with a sense of liberation – a temporary release from real-world obligations or
stress while playing. For example, a lighthearted party game might make players laugh and
forget their worries for an hour . Psychologically, this blends immersion (losing oneself in fun) and
freedom (feeling unburdened), which is very rewarding. Many players turn to games to relax or
lift  their  mood,  and  indeed  a  recent  scientific  study  found  that  satisfying  gameplay  can
modestly improve players’ affective well-being (happiness). In short, games make us feel good.
Challenge,  mastery,  and  flow: Most  great  games  involve  challenge,  and  humans  generally
enjoy a challenge – as long as it’s at the right level. A game that is too easy becomes boring,
while one that is too hard becomes frustrating; the sweet spot in between creates a state of
flow.  Flow is the highly focused, absorbed state where we lose track of time because the task

difficulty perfectly matches our skill (not too easy, not too hard). In games, reaching flow is
common – think of a chess player deep in concentration or a gamer so absorbed that hours fly
by unnoticed. Designers strive to achieve this balance of challenge vs. skill, keeping players “in
the zone” as shown in the diagram below :
In the flow channel (bright yellow region), the game’s challenge matches the player’s skill – avoiding anxiety
from overly hard tasks and  boredom from overly easy ones. This balance produces deep enjoyment and
engagement.
When a player overcomes a tough challenge, the pleasure is immense. In fact, triumph over adversity
gives rise to a specific emotion that game researchers call  “fiero.” Fiero (Italian for “pride”) is that
intense exhilaration we feel at moments of victory – “we throw our arms over our head and yell” in
triumph. It’s the feeling you get after finally beating a brutal boss in a video game or completing a long,
difficult puzzle. Psychologist Jane McGonigal notes that fiero is one of the biggest reasons people play
games – it’s “an intense emotion that many of us crave”. Neurologically, fiero comes with one of the
strongest  dopamine  rushes we  can  experience  as  reward  for  a  hard-won  success.  Great  games
provide clear goals and escalating challenges to fuel this sense of accomplishment. They also make
sure to calibrate difficulty so that victory feels earned but still attainable – if a game is so punishing that
players give up, they’ll never get to feel fiero, so tuning the game to let players  regularly experience
moments of triumph is a key design challenge. In summary, people love games that challenge them
and allow them to  build mastery, because beating a challenge yields pride, satisfaction, and often a
compelling urge to seek the next challenge.
Progress and feedback (competence): Related to mastery, games are built around progression
systems (points, levels, scores, badges, new items) that constantly signal improvement. Humans
enjoy seeing progress; it feeds our need for competence. Unlike real life, games give  clear,
immediate feedback for our actions – points pop up, a quest is marked complete, a sound chimes
for a correct move – which reinforces a sense of achievement and effectiveness. This constant
feedback is deeply satisfying psychologically, as it provides tangible proof of success or learning.
Many games use  level-up systems or skill trees to show players how far they’ve come, which
boosts confidence and motivates further play. For example, in an RPG when your character gains
a  level  and  new  abilities,  you  feel  more  powerful –  a  direct  hit  of  competence  fulfillment.
Dopamine, the brain’s reward chemical, is released when we accomplish tasks or get pleasant
surprises, so these feedback loops literally create  little bursts of pleasure that encourage us to
keep playing. Designers also leverage the anticipation of rewards – e.g. a progress bar almost
full  or  a  mystery  loot  box  waiting  to  be  opened  can  be  as  motivating  as  the  reward  itself,
because  the  suspense  keeps  us  engaged.  All  these  elements  (points,  rewards,  immediate
feedback) contribute to why players like games: they make us feel competent and rewarded at
each step, in a way that is clear and structured compared to many real-world activities.
Social connection and competition:Humans are social creatures, and games – especially
board and multiplayer video games – are a social playground. Many people love games because
they bring people together in ways other activities do not. Board games, for instance, involve
sitting  around  a  table  talking,  laughing,  and  strategizing  face-to-face,  which  fosters  social
bonds and friendly interaction. Cooperative games let us experience teamwork and unity toward
a  common  goal,  building  camaraderie.  Competitive  games,  on  the  other  hand,  add  the
excitement of rivalry – pushing us to outsmart friends within a safe,  “friendly conflict” context.
Both cooperation and competition can be enjoyable, and the best games often include a bit of
both,  allowing  players  to  team  up  or  face  off  as  they  prefer  (which  also  gives  a  sense  of
autonomy in how to play). Notably, “fun is more fun when shared” – research indicates people
often find experiences more enjoyable when they do them with others. It’s no surprise that a
• 
• 
3

majority of gamers prefer playing with others: for example,  66% of American gamers play
video games socially (with others) most of the time. Online video games tap into this by
enabling global social play (guilds, chat, streaming), while board games provide an in-person
social outlet. In either case, games satisfy our desire to belong to a group, to communicate,
and to feel the special bond that comes from shared play. Even when playing alone, knowing
others are playing the same game (competing on leaderboards, or discussing it in communities)
can create a  sense of connection. In short, people enjoy the  social dimension of games –
whether it’s the cooperation in a game like Pandemic (a board game where players team up to
beat the game) or the competition of Mario Kart with friends trash-talking on the couch, games
create memorable social experiences.
Immersion and escapism: Games transport us to different worlds or roles, appealing to our
imagination. A captivating game can make hours feel like minutes because we’re so immersed in
its story or environment. This is enjoyable in two ways: first, it satisfies curiosity and the desire to
experience new things (e.g. exploring a beautiful fantasy land in a video game, or imagining
oneself a detective in a mystery board game); second, it provides escapism, a mental break from
reality. As one psychologist put it, games create  “active involvement and immersion intended for
pure  enjoyment”,  giving  us  pleasant  sensations  of  being  in  a  different  reality.  For  example,
narrative-heavy games like  The Witcher or  Arkham Horror (board game) pull players into rich
stories, temporarily freeing them from everyday concerns. This sense of being elsewhere and
“letting  loose” is  liberating  and  restorative.  Many  gamers  cherish  this  opportunity  to
temporarily step away from the real world – to fly a starfighter , build a medieval city, or be a
hero saving the world –  with no real consequences. Psychologically, such  imaginative play can
reduce stress and satisfy our creative, exploratory impulses. Immersive games also often involve
art and aesthetics (visuals, music, theme), which players appreciate for their own sake. In sum,
players like games that offer a compelling alternate experience or story in which they can lose
themselves and feel free.
Strategy, problem-solving and creativity: A lot of games are essentially puzzles or strategic
challenges, and humans generally enjoy solving problems.  Board games, for example, often
engage our brains with strategy and planning – whether it’s chess or a complex Eurogame,
there’s pleasure in devising a plan and seeing it succeed. This cognitive stimulation scratches
the itch for mental exercise, giving a satisfying sense of achievement when our strategy pays off.
Games allow safe risk-taking too: players can try bold moves or experiments within the game
(bluffing  in  poker ,  choosing  a  risky  strategy)  without  real-life  repercussions,  which  is  both
educational and thrilling. Video games similarly often challenge players with tactical or logistical
problems (resource management, spatial puzzles, etc.). People who enjoy  learning and using
new skills find games rewarding because a well-designed game gradually teaches you skills and
then tests you in interesting ways. In fact, the act of learning and mastering new mechanics in a
game itself triggers dopamine release, contributing to the fun. Meanwhile, games that offer
creative outlets (like sandbox or building games – e.g. Minecraft or a level editor in Super Mario
Maker) appeal to our inventive side. They provide a playground for imagination and creativity,
which many find deeply satisfying. Being creative or clever within a game’s rules gives a sense of
ownership and pride in one’s personal approach to the game.
Tangible and nostalgic appeal (in board games): While video games deliver many of the above
pleasures digitally, board games add a tactile, physical dimension that people love. Handling
cards, tokens, or dice engages our senses – there’s something pleasing about shuffling cards or
moving a piece on a board. The  physicality makes the experience feel more concrete or “real”
than virtual games. Many also carry nostalgic value: classic board games remind us of childhood
or family time, invoking warm feelings. This nostalgia and the tradition of gathering around a

table  contribute  to  why  people  continue  to  enjoy  board  games  even  in  a  digital  age.  It
reconnects us with simpler times and face-to-face social play, which can be very emotionally
rewarding.
All these aspects – challenge, mastery, social interaction, immersion, feedback, creativity, etc. – are the
“fun factors” that make games attractive. Different games emphasize different factors (for instance, a
party  game  emphasizes  social  laughter  and  low-skill  fun,  whereas  a  flight  simulator  emphasizes
mastery and immersion). A key point for designers is that  fun isn’t one-dimensional: as researcher
Nicole  Lazzaro  found,  games  can  offer  “Hard  Fun” (challenge  and  fiero),  “Easy  Fun” (curiosity  and
amusement), “People Fun” (social enjoyment), and even “Serious Fun” (meaning or learning). The more of
these angles a game can fulfill  without diluting the experience, the more engaging it can be to a
wider audience.
Emotions Games Evoke (and When)
Playing games can fire the whole gamut of human emotions – from joyous highs to anger and fear –
often more intensely than other media because interactive involvement makes the feelings personal.
Here are some common emotions in gaming, and when/why they arise:
Joy and Happiness: Games frequently make players happy, both in moment-to-moment fun and
as  an  overall  mood  boost.  As  discussed,  beating  challenges  or  receiving  rewards  triggers
dopamine-fueled pleasure, leading to smiles and a sense of  well-being during play. Many
gamers play to unwind or cheer up; accordingly, research notes that many players use games to
relieve stress or regulate emotions. Lighthearted games (like a silly party game or a whimsical
adventure) especially create joy through humor and playful surprise. Co-op victories or shared
funny moments with friends also amplify joy – there’s a special giddy happiness in celebrating a
win together or laughing over a game’s events.
Fiero  (Pride/Triumph): As  described  earlier ,  fiero  is  the  explosive  excitement and  pride  in
accomplishment that comes at peak moments – the “Yes! I did it!” feeling. Players typically feel
fiero  right after overcoming a significant obstacle: defeating a tough boss, winning a close
multiplayer match, solving a puzzle that had them stumped, etc. The harder the challenge, the
bigger the fiero payoff on victory. This emotion is often visible – e.g., a player might literally jump
off the couch with fists in the air after a clutch win. Fiero is highly addictive in a positive way;
it’s  what  makes  people  persevere  through  hard  games  like  Dark  Souls or  lengthy  strategic
campaigns,  chasing  that  eventual  triumphant  high.  Good  game  design  spaces  out
challenges to provide periodic fiero moments, which keep players hooked on the emotional ride.
Curiosity and Surprise: Games often spark curiosity (what’s behind that door? how can I craft
this item?) and deliver surprise (a plot twist, a hidden level, a random funny event). Anticipation
is a powerful emotional driver – for example, the suspense of a mystery box or the final move in a
chess game can create intense focus and excitement. Players feel a rush when a game surprises
them in a delightful way or when they discover something unexpected. This ties into the “Easy
Fun” – the pure enjoyment of exploring and uncovering new experiences. Puzzle games evoke
the  “Eureka!” feeling  –  a  burst  of  joy  and  relief  when  figuring  out  the  solution  after  being
perplexed.
Flow (Focused Contentment): When in a flow state, players experience a calm yet energized
focus, sometimes described as contentment or serenity in the moment. It’s not an emotion
with a name like joy or anger , but rather a state where emotions are balanced – the player feels

--- Page 6 ---
in control and fully absorbed. During flow, a player might feel confident and engaged, with a
mild exhilaration at sustained success. After a flow session, players often feel  satisfied or even
surprised at how time flew. Achieving flow frequently produces a positive mood and is linked to
overall  happiness  if  experienced  regularly.  This  is  why  a  great  game  that  induces  flow  can
become a beloved hobby – it consistently puts the player in an enjoyable focused mindset.
Frustration and Anger: On the flip side of challenge lies frustration – when a game’s difficulty
or  design  crosses  the  line  from  motivating  to  disheartening.  Players  feel  frustration  when
progress is blocked or they fail repeatedly without understanding why. For example, dying 20
times in a row at the same level, or losing to an opponent because of factors outside your
control, breeds frustration. If not addressed, this can escalate to anger or “rage-quitting” – the
impulse to quit (or even physically throw a controller) in fury. Crucially, research shows that this
aggression stems not from violent content, but from  feelings of failure and lack of control
during  the  game.  In  psychological  terms,  the  game  is  threatening  the  player’s  sense  of
competence or fairness, and they respond with anger . Nearly every gamer has experienced this:
for  instance,  a  laggy  online  match  or  a  “cheap”  enemy  attack  that  kills  you  can  provoke
immediate anger because it feels unfair or preventable. While a bit of frustration can motivate a
player to try again,  too much causes them to stop having fun.  Boredom can similarly cause
negative  feelings  –  if  the  game  is  too  easy  or  repetitive,  a  player  might  feel  irritation  or
disappointment at the lack of engagement. In game design,  frustration and boredom are
considered the archenemies of fun and flow. A well-designed game tries to minimize these by
smoothing  out  unfair  spikes  in  difficulty,  giving  players  tools  to  overcome  challenges,  and
keeping the experience varied.
Fear and Anxiety: Some games deliberately evoke fear – notably horror games (like Resident Evil
or Amnesia) – by putting players in tense, threatening scenarios. The emotion of fear in a game
can manifest as heart-pounding anxiety, jump-scare shock, or creeping dread. Interestingly, many
people enjoy this in a game because it’s akin to a rollercoaster: a controlled dose of fear that
ultimately is safe. The adrenaline rush from narrowly escaping a monster or surviving a scary
encounter can actually be exhilarating. Even non-horror games can create short-term anxiety in
high-pressure moments (say, a last-second penalty kick in FIFA or a do-or-die round in Counter-
Strike). The key is that these feelings resolve – the fearful tension releases into relief (if you
survive) or a burst of emotion (if you fail but then can try again). When designed well, these
tension-and-release cycles produce excitement. However , if a game makes a player too anxious
without payoff, it may stop being fun; as mentioned, sustained anxiety moves one out of the flow
zone (see the diagram) into an unenjoyable state.
Sadness and Empathy: Games can also make players feel sad or moved, particularly through
storytelling and characters. Many modern games have deep narratives that can be as emotional
as films or novels. Players might feel sadness if a beloved character dies, or regret at a morally
difficult choice they had to make in a story-driven game. Because games are interactive, these
emotions can hit even harder – you took the action that led to a tragic outcome, or you failed to
save someone, which can create a strong empathetic response. For example, players of The Last
of Us often report emotional moments of grief, and indie games like That Dragon, Cancer were
explicitly designed to share an experience of loss and love, making many players cry. While not
“fun”  in  the  silly  sense,  these  powerful  emotions  are  part  of  why  people  value  games  as
meaningful  experiences.  They  provide  a  safe  space  to  experience  and  process  emotions.
Moreover , the lows can make the highs more impactful – a bittersweet story can make victory
more profound or messages more thought-provoking.

Social Emotions: In multiplayer settings, games can trigger social emotions like trust, loyalty,
betrayal, or guilt. A cooperative board game can lead to feelings of trust and solidarity (“we
worked so well together!”). A hidden-traitor game (e.g.  Among Us or  Battlestar Galactica board
game) might cause playful suspicion or betrayal feelings when one friend deceives the others –
often  followed  by  laughter  and  mock  outrage  when  revealed.  Competition can  also  evoke
respect for an opponent, or envy, or triumph of outdoing a rival. Importantly, because games
happen within a “magic circle” of agreed rules, people often feel free to express emotions like
aggression or mischief in-game without repercussions – e.g. trash-talking a friend during a game
doesn’t (or shouldn’t) carry over outside the game. This  protected frame of play allows us to
experience  these  emotions  intensely  but  safely.  After  the  match,  good  sportsmanship  and
shared  post-game  analysis  can  even  strengthen  friendships  due  to  the  emotional  journey
shared.
In  sum,  games  are  a  rich  emotional  playground.  The  key  for  enjoyment is  that  positive  emotions
(excitement, joy, pride, camaraderie) generally outweigh the negatives (frustration, anxiety) across the
experience. When they do, players describe the game as engaging or fun. When negative emotions
dominate – like a game that’s mostly stressful or anger-inducing – players will likely quit. This balance is
why game designers talk about making a game challenging but fair, scary but not hopeless, sad but
meaningful,  etc.  The  right  emotional  mix,  tuned  to  the  intended  audience,  is  central  to  a  game’s
success.
What People Don’t Like About Games
Just as there are common pleasures in games, there are common pain points that turn players off. For
game designers, these are pitfalls to avoid.  Players tend to dislike games (or moments in games)
that produce:
Excessive Frustration: A bit of challenge is fun, but if a game crosses the line into punishing the
player too much, it breeds frustration. As noted, when players feel stuck in a futile situation or
that the game is “cheating” them, fun turns into rage. For example, if a game has clumsy controls
or unclear rules, failing because of the interface (not your skill) is very frustrating. Unavoidable
deaths, extreme difficulty spikes, or heavy penalties for mistakes can likewise make players
angry. No one enjoys feeling incompetent or out of control. In fact, studies show that  when
people feel they have no control over the outcome, it leads to aggression and quitting –
regardless of game genre. Thus, a poorly tuned game that often makes the player feel helpless
or unfairly treated will quickly lose its audience. Players want challenge, but fair challenge. They
dislike “cheap shots” or random failure that they couldn’t have prevented.
Boredom and Repetition: On the opposite end, a game that’s too easy, slow, or repetitive will
not hold attention.  Boredom is a game-killer – players will simply drop a game that doesn’t
stimulate them enough. This could be due to overly simplistic gameplay, lack of new content, or
too much grinding (repeating the same task) without payoff. For instance, if a mobile game
requires hours of doing the exact same action to progress, many will get bored and leave. As one
industry analysis put it: “The two most important reasons players quit are frustration and boredom –
the archenemies of flow.” Either extreme breaks engagement. Good games avoid monotony by
introducing new challenges, mechanics, or story developments to keep things fresh. If a game
fails to do so, players will feel it’s “more of the same” and lose interest. Essentially, gamers do not
like feeling that their time is wasted or that nothing they do in the game is interesting after a
while.

Lack of Meaningful Progress: Tied to boredom is the sense of grinding with no payoff. If a
game makes players slog without clear rewards or advancement, it starts to feel like busywork
instead of fun. For example, imagine an RPG where you must defeat 100 trivial monsters to gain
one level – players might tire of this grind if it’s not fun in itself. Games that feel like a chore or
“second job” are often abandoned. Psychologically, if the intrinsic fun dries up and only extrinsic
rewards (points, etc.) remain, motivation plunges. As game design blogs often note, if a game
starts feeling like work, players ask “why am I even doing this?” and quit. Thus, designers must be
careful with repeating tasks and ensure players feel a sense of progress and purpose. Without
that, players will dislike the experience.
Overemphasis on Extrinsic Rewards: While points and badges are motivating, too much focus
on  rewards  (and  not  enough  on  fun  gameplay) can  backfire.  Psychology  warns  of  the
“overjustification” effect – if you flood someone with rewards for something they’d otherwise
enjoy, they might lose intrinsic interest. In games, this means if the design is only about grinding
for rewards (like incessant loot boxes, or pay-to-win monetization), players may feel manipulated
or find the core gameplay hollow.  Modern players are savvy; many dislike games that are
obviously trying to nickel-and-dime them or hook them with slot-machine tactics. A well-known
example  is  the  backlash  against  games  with  aggressive  microtransactions  or  gambling-like
reward loops – players often complain these undermine the fun or make the game unfair . Good
games strike a balance: they use rewards to enhance fun, not replace it, and avoid  too many
dopamine “treats” to the point that it actually inhibits long-term enjoyment.
Poor  Social  Experiences: If  playing  a  game  with  others,  certain  negatives  can  arise:  toxic
behavior,  cheating,  or  imbalance.  Many  players  quit  competitive  games  because  of  toxic
communities  –  constant  harassment  or  unsportsmanlike  conduct  makes  the  experience
unpleasant. Similarly, if a game allows cheating or has rampant unfair play (say, hackers in an
online shooter , or one player always dominating a board game by exploiting a loophole), other
players will not enjoy it. People play for fun and fairness; if the social environment is poisonous
or the game design favors one type of player to the detriment of others (without recourse), the
motivation to play evaporates. In short,  players dislike toxic or unfair atmospheres. This is
why game developers now invest in systems to curb toxicity and ensure  fair matchmaking – a
recognition that a game’s social context must be managed for everyone to have fun.
Confusion and Cognitive Overload: A more straightforward dislike is when a game is  too
confusing or difficult to learn initially. If the tutorial or rules are poorly explained, players
might feel lost and frustrated quickly. An overly complex board game without a good rulebook,
or a video game with a clunky user interface, can turn players off before they get to the good
part. People generally dislike feeling stupid; a game should make the player feel smart and
capable, not confused. Thus, a bad first-time user experience (FTUE) – such as a complicated
setup or lack of guidance – is a common reason players walk away. Smooth onboarding is
crucial because players won’t like a game that doesn’t respect their time in teaching them
how to play.
To summarize, frustration and boredom are the big offenders that drive players away. These often
stem from deeper issues: unfair design, lack of challenge balance, absence of meaningful progress, or
social toxicity. A great game mitigates these negatives by keeping the player appropriately challenged,
rewarded, and respected. When players do complain about a game, it’s usually because one of these
psychological needs was violated – for example, their need for competence was thwarted by unfair failures,
or their need for autonomy was stifled by tedious, forced grind, or their need for relatedness was hurt by a
nasty community. Game designers must remember that a game should ultimately be an enjoyable,

voluntary  activity –  anything  that  consistently  makes  it  feel  like  suffering  or  obligation will  be
something players “don’t like” and avoid.
Psychological Keys to Great Game Design
Designing a great game means crafting an experience that consistently satisfies human psychological
needs while minimizing the pitfalls we discussed. From a psychology standpoint, great games tend to
do the following:
Balance challenge and skill (Flow): Great games keep players in that magical flow zone as much
as possible. They offer adjustable or scaling difficulty so that both newcomers and veterans can
find the experience neither too easy (boredom) nor too hard (anxiety). This might mean having
difficulty settings, adaptive AI, or a smooth learning curve that introduces complexity gradually.
By “asking you to do something just out of reach” and then letting you achieve it, great games give
players the thrill of growth  level after level. A classic example is  Super Mario Bros. World 1-1
design – it subtly teaches the player through easy obstacles and ramps up, a result of careful
playtesting by Nintendo to hit that flow sweet spot.  Clear goals and immediate feedback
(hallmarks of flow) are always present – players always know what they’re trying to do and get
response on how they’re doing, keeping them focused and motivated.
Frequently satisfy competence with fiero moments: The best games  make the player feel
powerful and accomplished at regular intervals. This doesn’t mean they make everything easy,
but they set up victories that feel significant. Whether it’s beating a boss, completing a quest, or
simply improving a personal high score, great games ensure the player has  something to be
proud of after each session. They often do this via short-term and long-term goals structure
: there are big overarching goals (save the kingdom, finish the story, etc.) which give a sense
of purpose, but also many short-term targets (beat the next level, find the next collectible) that
keep yielding satisfaction and a sense of progress along the way. This layered goal design
means  the  player  is  never  far  from  the  next  accomplishment,  maintaining  motivation.  Great
games also tend to celebrate the player’s achievements – with fanfare, unlocks, story payoffs,
etc. – reinforcing that feeling of competence and success.
Provide autonomy and meaningful choices: Psychologically, people enjoy games more when
they feel in control of their actions. Thus, a great game gives players agency – meaningful choices
that affect strategy, story, or outcomes. For example, an open-world video game might let you
choose your quests or playstyle (catering to autonomy need), and a board game might allow
multiple paths to victory. Even linear games can offer choices in how you solve a problem or
customize your character . Voluntary play itself is a form of autonomy – the player should always
feel “I want to do this,” not “I have to do this.” That’s why the elimination of unnecessary grind or
the inclusion of optional content for extra challenge can improve a game’s reception. In short,
great games respect player freedom, never forcing prolonged activity that isn’t fun. They also allow
creativity:  emergent  gameplay,  user  strategies,  or  modding  can  all  enhance  the  sense  of
ownership. Empowering the player to play their way (to an extent) is a psychological boon that
increases enjoyment.
Foster  relatedness  and  community: From  a  design  perspective,  even  single-player  games
benefit from acknowledging the social nature of play. Great games often include features that let
players share experiences – high score tables, ghosts of other players, forums for fan content,
etc., which create a community around the game. In multiplayer games, tools to find friends or
team up (guild systems, matchmaking, chat) and systems to encourage positive interaction

(cooperative incentives, balanced competition) are key. The best multiplayer games cultivate a
culture of fair play and camaraderie, because that keeps players invested long-term. Many
successful games also organize events, challenges, or content updates that unite the player
base, reinforcing the social bond (think of seasonal events in online games that bring everyone
together for a goal). Essentially, great games recognize that playing is often a social act, and
they reinforce the player’s feeling of being connected to others who share the activity. Even
around a physical table, a well-designed board game ensures everyone gets to participate and
no one is left out – facilitating fun for all, which in turn makes the experience enjoyable for each
individual.
Engage emotions with a positive tilt: A hallmark of a great game is that it makes you feel a
lot, and leaves you feeling good overall. This could mean a thrilling rollercoaster of tension and
relief in a strategy game, a deeply moving narrative in a story game, or lighthearted goofy fun in
a  party  game  –  what’s  appropriate  depends  on  the  genre.  But  the  emotional  design  is
intentional.  Great  games  often  use  psychological  pacing:  periods  of  challenge  (tension)
followed by reward or rest (relief), bits of humor to diffuse stress, rising stakes in the story that
lead  to  a  cathartic  climax,  etc.  They  aim  to  create  emotional  highs (excitement,  laughter ,
triumph) that outweigh the lows (frustration, defeat). Importantly, failures in a great game are
framed as learning experiences, not dead-ends. For example, when you fail a level, the game might
give a hint or simply encourage you to try a different strategy, rather than just punish you. This
helps  turn  potential  frustration  into  a  motivation  to  improve  (maintaining  the  player’s  self-
efficacy). Additionally, many top games pay attention to story and thematic resonance – even
simple  games  benefit  from  a  bit  of  narrative  or  context  that  gives  meaning  to  the  player’s
actions, which can create an emotional connection. In summary, a great game is one that knows
which emotions it wants to evoke in the player and carefully crafts the experience to hit those
notes, leaving the player emotionally satisfied.
Continual novelty and learning: Psychologically, humans love  novelty – new stimuli grab our
attention. Great games keep introducing new elements or challenges to maintain interest. This
could be new enemy types, new power-ups, plot twists, or increasing complexity that keeps the
player learning. A game that evolves over time prevents the stagnation of boredom. Importantly,
great game design teaches the player  how to handle the new things in an intuitive way, so the
learning curve feels rewarding rather than overwhelming. As Raph Koster famously said, “Fun is
just another word for learning” – players enjoy mastering new patterns. So, the best games
are essentially excellent teachers that present novel problems and give players the tools to master
them, yielding satisfaction. This constant learning also feeds into the  progress/competence
loop, as the player can look back and see how much more capable they are now compared to
when they started.
Polish and usability: Though not a pure psychology theory, it’s worth noting that a frictionless
user experience is crucial. Great games minimize  confusion and extraneous frustration by
having clear instructions, intuitive controls, and fairness in mechanics. This ensures players stay
in a positive mental state. If a game’s controls or rules “disappear” (i.e. the player doesn’t have to
fight  the  interface),  the  player  can  fully  immerse  and  enjoy  the  psychological  rewards  we
discussed. High-quality audio-visual feedback (satisfying sound effects, attractive graphics) also
enhance enjoyment by making feedback more visceral and understandable (e.g. a triumphant
music cue when you win, or a clear visual indicator of a low health state). All these polish
elements contribute to the player’s subconscious comfort and satisfaction with the game.
Ethical engagement, not exploitation: Modern designers are increasingly aware that while
certain psychological tricks (like variable reward schedules or fear of missing out) can increase

engagement,  overusing  them  can  harm  players’  well-being  or  enjoyment.  A  great  game  uses
psychology responsibly – it tries to keep players hooked through enjoyment and mastery rather
than through dark patterns or excessive compulsion loops. This means respecting the player’s
time (e.g. not locking fun behind 10 hours of grind), offering optional monetization that doesn’t
skew fairness, and ensuring that the game can be enjoyed in healthy sessions. Games that do
this earn goodwill from players, who then feel safe indulging in the game. From a psychological
standpoint, a player who trusts the game is not trying to manipulate or exploit them is more
likely to fully engage and enter flow, rather than have a defensive posture. In contrast, if players
sense a game is basically a Skinner box to extract money or a platform for ads, they’ll not
genuinely like it for long. Thus, fairness, transparency, and an emphasis on intrinsic fun over
extrinsic bait are key to a game being great in the eyes of players.
Finally, a great game often aligns with what makes play fun on a human level. As one board game
industry  article  concluded,  the  enduring  appeal  of  games  is  that  they  “appeal  to  our  desires  for
connection, mastery, and fun”, allowing us to challenge our minds, connect with others, and enjoy the
journey. That is a beautiful summary of the psychology of play. If a game consistently delivers a sense
of challenge and mastery, provides social or narrative connection, and most of all is fun, it will likely
stand out as a great game. By understanding these psychological drivers – why humans play and what
we crave from games – designers can create experiences that not only entertain, but also resonate
deeply with players’ motivations and emotions.
