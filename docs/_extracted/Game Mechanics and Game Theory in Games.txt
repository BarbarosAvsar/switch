Game Mechanics and Game Theory in Games
Game Mechanics: Definition and Overview
Game mechanics are the rules or methods that define how a game operates and how players interact
with it . In both tabletop and video games, mechanics govern what actions players can take and how
the game responds. They are the fundamental building blocks of gameplay – for example, the L-shaped
move of the knight in chess is a mechanic (a  ludeme, or unit of play) that constrains that piece’s
movement. The combination and interplay of various mechanics determine a game’s complexity
and player experience. Notably, mechanics are distinct from a game’s theme or story: two games might
share similar mechanics but feel different due to thematic context (consider the  property trading in
Monopoly vs. resource trading in a farming game). Mechanics are also distinct from gameplay itself
– gameplay emerges when players engage with mechanics. 
Categories of Game Mechanics: Game designers and scholars often categorize mechanics to better
analyze and classify games. For instance, Engelstein and Shalev’s taxonomy (in  Building Blocks of
Tabletop  Game  Design)  divides  mechanics  into  groups  like  game  structure (turn  order ,  actions),
economics (resource management, auctions),  uncertainty (randomness elements),  conflict (combat,
area control), progression (engine-building, technology trees), and so on. Broadly, mechanics can
be about how turns are structured, how players move or act, how resources are handled, how random
chance is introduced, how players interact or conflict, and how victory is determined. In video games,
one can also speak of core interaction mechanics (e.g. jumping, shooting, dialog choices) and how they
combine into systems. Below, we explore a wide range of game mechanics, organized by type, with
definitions and examples from both board games and video games.
Examples and Types of Game Mechanics
The universe of game mechanics is vast. What follows is a  comprehensive list of common game
mechanics, along with brief definitions and real-game examples (🎮 for video games,  for board/
tabletop games). This list illustrates the diversity of mechanics found in games:
Turn-Taking (Sequential Play): Games often progress in turns, where players act one after
another in a fixed order. This structure gives time for strategy between moves. Example: In
Chess ( ), White moves then Black moves, and in  Civilization (🎮) each player completes all
their actions before the next player’s turn. Some games use a game turn where all players act
(or choose actions) within the same round. Turn-based play corresponds to what game theory
calls a sequential game, where players can observe earlier actions before responding.
Simultaneous Action Selection: All players choose actions secretly and reveal them at once,
rather than waiting turns. This mechanic adds tension and requires predicting opponents’
choices. Example:Rock-Paper-Scissors ( ) is classic simultaneous play, and Diplomacy ( ) has all
players write down orders that execute simultaneously. In Race for the Galaxy ( ), each round
players secretly pick roles and reveal together. In game theory terms, this aligns with a
normal-form  (simultaneous)  game,  often  analyzed  for  Nash  equilibria  in  pure  or  mixed
strategies.

Action Points: Players are given a budget of points per turn to spend on actions. Each
possible action (move a unit, draw a card, etc.) costs a certain number of points, forcing players
to prioritize.  Example: In  Pandemic ( ), each player has 4 actions per turn to move or treat
diseases . In many tactical RPG video games (🎮), characters might have action points to
allocate to moving or attacking in a turn.
Action or Role Selection: A set of available actions or roles exists, but players may only choose a
subset (often one) each round. Often once one player chooses an action, others cannot (this
overlaps with action blocking). Example:Puerto Rico ( ) features role selection – if one player
takes the “Builder” role this round, others must choose different roles. In  Terraforming
Mars ( 🎮), players secretly pick two actions on their turn out of many options. This mechanic
ensures players specialize and not all do the same thing every round.
Worker Placement: A popular subset of action selection where players place tokens (“workers”)
on limited slots to perform actions. Once a slot is taken, others usually cannot use that
action, introducing blocking. Example:Caylus and Agricola ( ) pioneered worker placement: if
someone places a worker on the “Build Fence” space, no one else can build fences this round
. Even some strategy video games mimic this by assigning units to tasks (e.g. assigning
peons to gather resources in  Warcraft/StarCraft 🎮 has been likened to a worker placement
mechanic ). This mechanic emphasizes planning and turn order advantage.
Resource Management: Players collect and expend resources (coins, materials, mana, etc.) and
must optimize their use. Rules govern how resources are gained, traded, or converted, and
skillful management often correlates with success.  Example:Settlers of Catan ( ) revolves
around gathering wood, brick, etc., and trading them to build settlements. Real-time strategy
video games like  StarCraft (🎮) also hinge on gathering minerals & gas and spending them
efficiently. Resource valuation is dynamic – players must judge which resources are scarce or
critical at each stage.
Economics and Trading: Many games allow trading of resources or goods between players or
with  a  bank.  This  social-economic  mechanic  encourages  bargaining  and  deals.  Example:
Catan ( ) famously encourages “I’ll give you two sheep for one wood” style trades among players
. In  EVE Online (🎮), players engage in a massive virtual economy, trading minerals and
goods in a marketplace. Auction mechanics (see below) are another economic sub-type.
Auction/Bidding: Players bid against each other , typically with in-game money or resources, to
gain something (an item, turn order , a card). Auctions can be open-outcry (sequential bids) or
sealed (hidden bids).  Example: In  Power Grid ( ), players bid money to buy power plants each
round. In Modern Art ( ), various types of auctions (open, once-around, blind) are actually the
core of gameplay. Auction mechanics come in many forms (first-price where winner pays their
bid, or second-price where winner pays the second-highest bid, etc.), and each has strategic
nuances . For instance, in a first-price sealed auction, optimal play involves  bid shading –
bidding less than your true value – whereas a second-price auction encourages bidding your
honest value since you pay only the second-highest price.
Set Collection: Players collect sets of items (cards, tokens) usually for points or to trigger effects
.  The  value  often  increases  with  larger  sets.  Example: In  Ticket  to  Ride ( ),  collecting
matching colored train cards lets you claim routes, and collecting destination tickets fulfills set
objectives . In Pokémon games (🎮), collecting sets of gym badges unlocks progress. Engine
Building, a related concept, means using collected components to build a  synergy or combo

system that grows stronger over time. For example, Dominion ( 🎮) is a deck-building
game (a form of engine builder) where the cards you add to your deck create feedback loops
generating more money or actions as the game progresses.
Dice  Rolling  /  Randomization: Using  randomness  to  determine  outcomes  introduces
uncertainty . Dice are the classic randomizer: roll to move or to resolve combat. Card
draws, spinners, or digital RNG serve similar roles. Example:Monopoly ( ) uses dice rolls to move
around the board.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown (🎮) rolls virtual dice behind the scenes for hit
chances  in  combat.  Randomness  can  add  excitement  and  variability;  different  random
mechanisms produce different probability distributions (e.g. one six-sided die is a uniform 1–6,
two dice produce a bell curve 2–12). Many games also feature  Procedural generation for
randomness in level layouts or events.
Chance vs. Risk Management: Related to dice, some games explicitly include press-your-luck
mechanics: players can choose to take on more risk for a chance at greater reward. Example:
In  The  Quacks  of  Quedlinburg ( ),  players  draw  ingredients  from  a  bag  to  brew  potions,
pressing their luck not to draw a “bomb” ingredient that busts their potion. Video slot machines
or roguelike games (🎮) similarly tempt players to risk losing progress for potential big gains. A
good design balances the danger of risk against the reward, forcing probabilistic decision-making
.
Hidden Information and Deduction: Some mechanics involve information asymmetry – not all
players have the same information. This includes fog of war in war games, hidden traitor roles,
or secret card hands. Example:Clue (Cluedo) ( ) has secret murder cards that players deduce via
clues.  Poker ( ) gives each player private cards; the uncertainty of others’ hands is integral.
Social deduction games like  Werewolf/Secret Hitler ( ) give some players hidden identities
(e.g. traitors) that others must deduce by behavior. In  Among Us (🎮), a few players are
secretly imposters. These mechanics leverage deception and deduction skills.
Bluffing  and  Deception: Often  tied  to  hidden  information,  bluffing  is  the  mechanic  of
misleading  other  players  about  your  intentions  or  holdings.  Example:Poker ( )  again  is
quintessential – betting in poker often involves bluffing with a weak hand to convince opponents
you’re strong. In  Sheriff of Nottingham ( ), players bluff about the goods in their bag to
avoid penalties. Bluffing requires incomplete information; it shines in games where players must
make decisions without knowing everything. Successful bluffing means reading opponents and
manipulating their beliefs.
Memory Mechanics: Some games test the players’ memory. For example, matching games
where cards are face-down and you must remember positions (like the classic children’s game
Memory ( )) . Memory elements can also be part of larger games (e.g. remembering who
played what card in Bridge or which areas were shown to be safe in Minesweeper (🎮)).
Spatial Mechanics (Movement & Placement): Many board games use boards with areas or
grids; rules for  movement govern how pieces travel these spaces.  Example: In  Chess ( ),
each piece type has specific movement mechanics (knight’s L-shape, bishop’s diagonal, etc.). In
Sorry! or Snakes and Ladders ( ), movement is along a track by dice roll. Some games use area
movement on irregular regions (e.g.  Risk ( ) moves armies country to country). Video games
extend movement mechanics into continuous space and physics – e.g. the jumping mechanic in
Super Mario Bros. (🎮) or portal-creating in Portal (🎮) are spatial mechanics. Tile Placement is

another  spatial  mechanic:  players  place  tiles  to  form  a  board  or  pattern (e.g.
Carcassonne ( ) where drawing and laying tiles creates the map).
Combat and Capture: Conflict-oriented games often have mechanics for combat or capturing
pieces . Example: In Chess ( ), “capture” is moving onto an opponent’s piece to remove it.
War games like Risk or Axis & Allies ( ) have combat resolved by dice. Many video games have
combat systems (turn-based RPG battles, real-time shooting, etc.) which are essentially game
mechanics defining how enemies are defeated. Elimination is a related mechanic: players may
be eliminated from the game when they lose all pieces or health (e.g. players can be knocked out
in  Risk or  Fortnite (🎮),  leaving  a  last-man-standing  victory  condition).  Capture/eliminate
mechanics make a game more zero-sum and conflict-heavy.
“Take That” Mechanics: A colloquial term for moves that directly harm another player’s position
. These are often cards or actions you play  on opponents to set them back.  Example: In
Munchkin ( ), you can play curse cards on opponents to hinder their progress – the fun comes
from  lobbing  screw-over  moves  at  each  other.  Many  competitive  video  games  have
analogous actions (throwing a shell at another driver in Mario Kart (🎮) is a “take that” move). 
Hand Management: In card games, this refers to how players manage the cards in their hand –
which to play, hold, or discard to optimize outcomes. Example: In Bohnanza ( ), the order of
cards in hand is fixed, and you must cleverly play/trade to get good sets, exemplifying hand
management. In many  collectible card games like  Magic: The Gathering ( 🎮), deciding
when to play or keep certain cards is crucial, balancing short-term needs vs. future potential.
Drafting: Players pick items (cards, tiles, etc.) from a common pool in turn, often passing the
remainder to others. Drafting ensures everyone gets some choice from a limited set, and
denial of picks to others is part of the strategy. Example:7 Wonders ( ) uses card drafting each
age: you choose a card to play and pass the rest to your neighbor . In video game context,
drafting appears in modes like drafting champions in  League of Legends (🎮) where players
take turns picking unique characters for a match.
Deck/Pool Building: Starting with a simple deck of cards or pool of tokens, players acquire new
components to improve their set during play. This is  deck-building if it’s cards.  Example:
Dominion ( ) invented the deck-building genre: each player begins with a basic deck and buys
better cards to shuffle in, creating an evolving personal deck that hopefully yields stronger
combos over time. In video games, Slay the Spire (🎮) adapts this mechanic as you build a
deck of attacks/powers through a run.  Bag-building (drawing tokens from a bag) is a variant
seen in games like Orléans ( ).
Puzzle and Pattern Mechanics: Some games revolve around creating or recognizing patterns.
Pattern building might reward arranging pieces in certain configurations. Example:Azul ( )
scores points for creating specific color patterns in a mosaic.  Tetris (🎮) is essentially a
pattern-placement game under time pressure. Deduction puzzles (solving a mystery with clues)
or logic puzzles in games also count as mechanics when embedded in a larger game (as solving
them is required to progress).
Role-Playing and Narrative Choices: In many games (especially RPGs), a mechanic is giving
players choices to develop their character or influence a story. Example:Dungeons & Dragons ( )
has alignment mechanics (character morality) that can govern which abilities you can use.
Video RPGs like  Mass Effect (🎮) use dialogue choice systems (Paragon/Renegade) that affect

story  and  outcomes  –  these  are  mechanics  guiding  narrative  branching.  The  storytelling
mechanic can even be the focus (as in Rory’s Story Cubes ( ) or interactive fiction games).
Cooperative Mechanics: Not all games are competitive; co-op games have players versus the
game system. Mechanics here often involve communication limits, shared resources, and win/
lose conditions where either all players win together or lose together . Example:Pandemic ( ) is
fully cooperative – players must coordinate their different roles’ abilities to cure diseases before
time runs out. Left 4 Dead (🎮) is a co-op shooter where players must work together to survive
zombie  hordes.  These  games  use  mechanics  like  trading  information,  voting  on  decisions,  or
combining powers to encourage teamwork.
Hidden Traitor / One-vs-Many: A special subcategory of co-op is the hidden traitor mechanic –
one (or a few) player is secretly against the rest. Example:Battlestar Galactica board game ( )
has some players secretly Cylons working to sabotage the humans.  Among Us (🎮) similarly
assigns a few impostors among crewmates. The mechanics here blend cooperation (for the loyal
players) with deduction and betrayal. A  one-vs-many game like  Fury of Dracula ( ) has one
player openly against all others, sometimes using hidden movement or separate rules for the
one (the Dracula player moves secretly, the hunters cooperate to find him).
Voting and Negotiation: Some games incorporate voting on outcomes or heavy negotiation
among players. Example: In Diplomacy ( ), negotiation is essentially free-form and unenforced –
players make deals and alliances (often broken later) to coordinate their moves, which is a
negotiation mechanic at its purest.  Twilight Imperium ( ) includes a political phase where
players vote on laws that change the game’s rules; voting power can depend on resources or
influence  collected.  Negotiation  and  voting  mechanics  introduce  coalition-building and
persuasion into gameplay – often the social skills of players become as important as the formal
game rules.
Time Pressure (Real-Time Play): Not all games proceed in discrete turns; some use real-time
action or timed turns. Real-time board games require players to act simultaneously under time
constraints. Example:Space Alert ( ) gives players 10 minutes to coordinate a defense plan
in real time with a soundtrack timer . Video games commonly are real-time; a notable mechanic is
a  timer or time limit (e.g. you have 2 minutes to finish a level, or a shrinking circle in  battle
royale games forcing timely action). A chess clock or sand timer can enforce time limits in turn-
based games. Time-based mechanics test players’ quick decision-making and add intensity.

A turn-based game in action: A chess board with a chess clock. Each player must manage their allotted time
while taking turns – a classic example of sequential turn-taking and time-keeping as game mechanics.
Victory and Loss Conditions: Every game defines how to win (and sometimes how one can lose)
. Victory conditions could be reaching a certain score, being the last survivor , completing a
quest, etc. . Some games even have multiple victory conditions or intermediate goals. 
Example: In Chess, the victory condition is checkmating the opponent’s king; in Settlers of
Catan, it’s achieving 10 victory points (via building, largest army, etc.). Some video games have 
alternate endings depending on which victory condition is met (e.g. multiple win paths in 
Civilization – military conquest, science, culture, etc.). Loss conditions (like player elimination or
collective loss if a doom track fills up) shape the tension – e.g. if the virus outbreak meter hits
maximum in Pandemic, all players lose. Many modern games include catch-up mechanics
that prevent early leaders from running away with victory: for instance, in Mario Kart (🎮) the
items system gives better power-ups to players further behind, and in Catan the robber piece
specifically hinders the leading player. These mechanics are designed for balance, ensuring
all players feel they have a chance until the end.
The list above is not exhaustive, but it covers a broad array of known game mechanics and terms – from
core structural mechanics (turns, actions) to  interaction mechanics (trading, combat, bluffing) to
resource and progression mechanics (engine-building, set collection) and beyond. Game designers
mix  and  match  these  to  create  unique  gameplay  experiences.  It’s  worth  noting  that  not  everyone
agrees on terminology or what counts as a “mechanic” (for example, some consider dexterity or physical
skill elements as mechanics, like flicking in  Carrom or Jenga-style balance challenges). Nonetheless,
having a shared vocabulary of mechanics allows us to analyze and compare games more precisely.
Game Theory: Principles and Major Models
If game mechanics are the rules of the game, game theory is the science of strategic decision-making in
games (and in real life scenarios abstracted as games). Game theory is an academic field that studies
situations  where  multiple  decision-makers  (called  players)  each  have  different  possible  actions
(strategies) and the outcome for each player depends on the choices of all. In other words, it’s the
study of strategic interaction – how rational players make choices, anticipating others’ choices, to
maximize their own benefit. Game theory originated in mathematics and economics, but its name

reflects that early examples were drawn from parlour games and thought experiments, and indeed its
terminology sounds like gaming: we speak of “players,” “moves,” “payoffs,” and “wins” or losses.
Basic Concepts: In game theory, any strategic situation can be modeled as a game defined by a set of
players, each player’s possible strategies, and a payoff function that assigns an outcome or utility to
each  combination  of  strategies.  A  core  assumption  (especially  in  classical,  non-cooperative  game
theory) is that players are  rational and seek to maximize their own payoff (utility). Importantly, the
payoff  can  be  anything  the  decision-maker  values  –  profit,  points,  survival  probability,  etc.  –  not
necessarily something as simple as money, but game theory often uses numerical payoffs for modeling
convenience.  The  key  feature  is  interdependence:  each  player’s  best  choice  often  depends  on  what
others do.
Some key distinctions in game theory models include:
Cooperative  vs.  Non-Cooperative  Games: In  non-cooperative game  theory,  binding
agreements  between  players  are  not  possible;  each  player  acts  independently  in  their  own
interest. The focus is on predicting individual strategy choices and equilibrium outcomes (e.g.
pricing  competition  between  firms,  or  two  players  in  poker  each  trying  to  maximize  their
winnings). Cooperative game theory, by contrast, allows players to form binding commitments
or coalitions and focuses on group outcomes and how to fairly allocate payoffs (e.g. dividing
profits among business partners who can make enforceable contracts). In the context of board/
video games, “cooperative game” usually refers to players vs. environment scenarios, which can
sometimes be mapped to a cooperative game theory problem (all players share identical payoff,
so coalition is trivial). Non-cooperative game theory is more often applied to analyze competitive
games and player behavior .
Zero-Sum vs. Non-Zero-Sum Games: A zero-sum (more generally, constant-sum) game is one in
which one player’s gain is exactly another’s loss, so the total payoff sums to zero (or some
constant) for any outcome. These are purely competitive situations – one winner , one loser ,
no possibility of mutual gain. Chess, for instance, is essentially zero-sum: a win for White is a loss
for Black. Many economic or social situations are non-zero-sum, where cooperation can create
win-win outcomes (or bad choices can be lose-lose). Non-zero-sum games allow the total payoff
to vary; players might all benefit from cooperation or all suffer from conflict. Example:Monopoly
can  be  seen  as  almost  zero-sum  –  when  one  player  profits,  ultimately  others  are  closer  to
bankruptcy (the game ends with one winner , others losing everything). In fact, the designer of
Monopoly’s precursor intended it as a lesson about how one player’s gain (landlord charging
rent) is others’ loss. In game theory, zero-sum games have special properties: the interests of
players  are  completely  opposed,  and  they  are  solved  by  minimax strategies.  Non-zero-sum
games include possibilities for both competition and cooperation.
Simultaneous vs. Sequential Games: As touched on earlier , this distinction is about the timing
of  moves  and  information.  In  a  simultaneous  game,  players  choose  their  actions  without
knowing  what  others  choose  (formally  represented  in  normal-form  payoff  matrices).  In  a
sequential game, players take turns or there is a defined order of play, and later players may
see earlier players’ moves before deciding (modeled in extensive form, like a game tree). 
Rock-Paper-Scissors is simultaneous; Chess is sequential. The solution methods differ: sequential
games  can  often  be  solved  by  backward  induction (looking  ahead  to  future  moves  and
reasoning backwards – finding a subgame-perfect equilibrium), whereas simultaneous games
require finding mutual best responses (Nash equilibria) without timing to differentiate moves.

Perfect  vs.  Imperfect  Information: A  game  has  perfect  information if  all  players  know
everything that has happened previously  and there are no hidden elements when making a
decision. Chess, again, is perfect information – the entire game state (pieces on the board) is
known to both players at all times, and nothing is hidden or random during decision-making (no
cards or simultaneous secrets). Imperfect information means something is unknown: perhaps
moves occur simultaneously (not knowing the other’s current move), or there are hidden cards,
or unobservable actions. Most card games (Bridge, Poker) are games of imperfect/incomplete
information because players have private information (their hand, or unknown card draws). In
video games, fog of war (not seeing the opponent’s units) creates imperfect information. Game
theory  calls  games  with  hidden  information  Bayesian  games or  games  of  incomplete
information, where players have beliefs about unknowns and might use probability and signals
in their strategy.
One-shot  vs.  Repeated  Games: A  one-shot  game is  played  only  once  –  players  choose
strategies a single time. A repeated game involves playing the same stage game multiple times
in sequence, possibly with strategies contingent on past play. Repetition can enable cooperation
or  punishment  strategies  that  aren’t  possible  in  one-shot  scenarios.  For  example,  a  single
Prisoner’s  Dilemma  (one-shot)  encourages  defection,  but  if  two  players  repeatedly  face  a
Prisoner’s  Dilemma,  they  might  sustain  cooperation  by  using  strategies  like  “tit-for-
tat” (reciprocating the other’s last move) because future consequences can deter short-term
selfishness . Many board games are one-shot by design (you play a match once and score
it), but some have repeated rounds that mimic this effect. Video games often have iterative
encounters or levels that can be seen as repeated strategic interactions (or players learn and
adjust across multiple matches in online games, effectively a repeated context).
Nash Equilibrium and Solution Concepts: One of the most fundamental ideas in game theory is the
Nash equilibrium – named after John Nash. A Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (one strategy for
each player) such that no player can unilaterally change their strategy and get a higher payoff. In
other words, at equilibrium, each player’s strategy is a best response to the others’ strategies; no one
has regrets or incentive to deviate given what others are doing. Nash’s great insight was that every
finite game (with a finite number of strategies) has at least one equilibrium if we allow mixed strategies
(players randomizing between moves). Equilibrium doesn’t necessarily mean a good or fair outcome
– it just means a stable one where expectations are met and no single player benefits from straying. For
example, if both players in Prisoner’s Dilemma choose to defect, that constitutes a Nash equilibrium
(neither  can  do  better  by  unilaterally  cooperating)  even  though  it’s  worse  for  both  than  mutual
cooperation.
Other solution concepts include dominant strategies (a strategy that is best for a player regardless of
what others do) and Pareto optimality (an outcome where no player can be made better off without
making someone else worse off, often used to judge the efficiency of outcomes, not a prediction of play
but a normative benchmark). There’s also  subgame-perfect equilibrium (a refinement of Nash for
sequential games, requiring the strategy to induce a Nash equilibrium in every subgame – essentially
ruling out non-credible threats in sequential play), Bayesian Nash equilibrium (equilibrium concept for
games with incomplete information, where players maximize expected payoff given their beliefs), and
so on. For the scope of this discussion, Nash equilibrium is the key concept linking game theory to how
strategic games are played, since players often seek a stable strategy combination (even if informally).

Major Models & Examples in Game Theory: Game theory often uses simple illustrative games to
model larger ideas. Some classic examples:
The Prisoner’s Dilemma: Perhaps the most famous game-theoretic model, this is a non-zero-
sum, non-cooperative game that demonstrates why two completely rational players might not
cooperate,  even  if  it  appears  that  it’s  in  their  best  interest  to  do  so.  The  scenario:  two
accomplices are arrested and interrogated separately. Each has two strategies:  Cooperate with
their partner (stay silent) or Defect (confess and implicate the other). The payoffs are set so that:
if both cooperate (stay silent), they get a moderate sentence (say 1 year each). If one defects
while the other stays silent, the defector goes free (0 years) and the cooperator gets the harsh
sentence (say 5 years). If both defect, they both get a somewhat harsh sentence (say 3 years
each).  Defection is  a  dominant  strategy  for  each  –  no  matter  what  the  other  does,  you’re
personally better off confessing (defecting). Unfortunately, when both follow that logic, the
outcome (both defect getting 3 years each) is worse for both than if both had cooperated (1 year
each) . Thus the Nash equilibrium (both defect) is Pareto inferior to the cooperative outcome.
The Prisoner’s Dilemma has myriad real-world analogues – arms races, price wars between
companies, tragedy of the commons, etc. – and it also pops up in games whenever players face a
choice to help each other for a mutual benefit or to selfishly take a bigger share at the expense
of others. In board game terms, if you’ve ever had an opportunity to either share a win or betray
an ally for a solo win, you were in a prisoner’s dilemma-like spot. Notably, in repeated play,
strategies  can  emerge  to  enforce  cooperation  (e.g.  tit-for-tat  as  mentioned:  if  your  partner
defected last time, punish them by defecting this time, otherwise cooperate), showing how trust
can be built or broken over time.
Matching  Pennies: A  simple  two-player  zero-sum game  often  used  to  demonstrate  mixed
strategy equilibrium. Each of two players chooses Heads or Tails for a penny; if the pennies
match (both Heads or both Tails), player Even wins (say, wins the opponent’s penny); if they
mismatch, player Odd wins. There is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium here – whatever
one player chooses, the other wants to choose the opposite to win, so any fixed strategy can be
exploited. The equilibrium is in mixed strategies: each player randomizes Heads or Tails with 50%
probability. This way, neither player can predict the other’s move and do better by deviating.
The expected payoff ends up 0 for both in equilibrium (a fair game). Matching pennies is
essentially the structure behind many  hide-and-seek or  guessing competitions (e.g. a football
(soccer) penalty kick: kicker chooses left or right, goalie dives left or right – one wants to match,
the other to mismatch). In game design, if you create a scenario with two balanced options and
adversarial  goals,  the  concept  of  a  mixed  strategy  equilibrium  might  manifest  as  players
unpredictably varying their choices (think of a rock-paper-scissors dynamic in strategy games,
where there’s no single best move but a cycle of counter-moves).
Zero-Sum Games and Minimax: In strictly competitive games (like chess, checkers, go, many
two-player  abstract  or  combinatorial  games),  game  theory  tells  us  players  should  aim  to
minimize  the  maximum  possible  loss –  the  minimax  strategy.  Von  Neumann’s  minimax
theorem states that in zero-sum games, the Nash equilibrium ensures each player’s expected
payoff is optimized under worst-case counterplay. For deterministic perfect-information games
like Chess, in theory game theory predicts either one player has a winning strategy or with
optimal play it’s a draw (as many believe chess is). AI algorithms often implement minimax
search with heuristics to approximate this optimal play. So, game theory underpins a lot of AI in
games: for example, Deep Blue’s chess strategy or any computer opponent in a zero-sum game
is essentially trying to approximate the game-theoretic solution.

The Game of Chicken: A non-cooperative game illustrating brinkmanship. Two drivers speed
toward each other; each can either  swerve or  stay straight. If one swerves and the other
doesn’t, the one who swerved is a “chicken” (loses face) and the straight driver “wins” (gets glory).
If both swerve, they both get a mediocre outcome (both save face somewhat). If neither swerves
(both stay straight), they crash – the worst outcome for both, far worse than just losing face. This
game has two Nash equilibria in pure strategies: (Swerve, Straight) and (Straight, Swerve) – each
hopes to be the one who stays straight while the other chickens out. But there is also a mixed
equilibrium where each player probabilistically risks staying straight to some extent. Chicken is
famous as a metaphor for nuclear standoffs, etc., but in games, any time players are in a mutual
harm scenario with incentive to be the more daring (but hoping the other backs off), it’s a
chicken dynamic. Some negotiation games or simultaneous action choices in games of chicken-
like payoff can be designed (e.g. a high-stakes variant of prisoner’s dilemma where mutual
defection is catastrophic instead of moderately bad becomes like chicken).
Stag Hunt: A game of coordination with a risk element. Two hunters can either hunt a stag
together or individually hunt a rabbit. A stag is worth much more than a rabbit, but one hunter
alone cannot catch it – it requires mutual cooperation. If one goes for stag and the other doesn’t,
the stag-hunter gets nothing (the stag escapes) while the other gets a modest rabbit. If both
hunt stag, they succeed and split a large reward. If both settle for rabbits, they each get a small
sure reward. Stag Hunt has two pure equilibria: both cooperate (hunt stag) or both play it safe
(hunt rabbit). It models trust and assurance: the best outcome is cooperation, but if you doubt
the other’s cooperation, you might opt for the safer bet. In games or multiplayer scenarios, stag
hunts appear when players must trust each other to pursue a high payoff strategy that will fail if
not everyone commits (e.g. in a raid in an MMO game, everyone must attack the boss at the
right time (stag) vs. each just doing their own thing for smaller rewards (rabbit)). It’s a positive-
spin on PD: here mutual cooperation is not only best but also an equilibrium (unlike PD), yet fear
can lead to a poorer equilibrium if trust isn’t achieved.
Battle of the Sexes (Coordination Game): A classic coordination problem where two players
want to meet but have different preferences for where. For example, one (say the wife) prefers
the opera, the other (the husband) prefers a football game, but most of all each would rather be
together than apart. If they end up in different places, that’s the worst outcome for both. This
game  has  two  Nash  equilibria  (one  at  opera,  one  at  football)  and  highlights  the  need  for
coordination or communication to choose an equilibrium – both prefer being together , but each
equilibrium favors one person’s preference. In board games, pure coordination games are less
common (since usually players have conflict), but the idea applies to things like agreeing on
conventions  (for  instance,  partners  in  a  game  like  Bridge  need  to  coordinate  bidding
conventions – it’s beneficial to match expectations).
Auction Models: In game theory, auctions are studied as games of incomplete information.
Each bidder has a private valuation for the item. Different auction formats (as discussed earlier)
create different strategic landscapes. For example, in a  first-price sealed-bid auction, each
player’s  best  bid  depends  on  their  own  value  and  their  beliefs  about  others’  values  –  the
equilibrium strategy (under certain assumptions) is to bid some fraction of one’s value (the bid
shading formula depends on distribution of values). In a  second-price (Vickrey) auction,
bidding truthfully one’s value is a dominant strategy (because if you win, you pay the second-
highest bid, so you can’t gain by misreporting). These theoretical results tie closely to how
bidding games in board games might be approached by savvy players. A game like Modern Art
or  QE (bidding game with hidden bids) can be analyzed with auction theory – though human
behavior may deviate due to risk attitudes or bluffing.

Game theory models often assume rational, self-interested players with common knowledge of the
game structure. In real gaming situations, people may have incomplete rationality, emotions, or house
rules that change things. Still, the concepts of game theory are powerful for understanding  strategic
games. Many board game rulesets read like formal game descriptions, and players often effectively
perform game-theoretic reasoning (e.g. "If I do this, she will likely do that, which would be bad for me,
so perhaps I should choose this other move instead…"). Good players often seek  equilibrium-like
strategies – ones that can’t be easily exploited by opponents.
Connecting Game Mechanics and Game Theory
Game mechanics create the  strategic situations that game theory seeks to analyze. There is a natural
correspondence  between  certain  mechanics  and  classic  game-theoretic  models.  Below,  we  draw
connections between specific game mechanics (from Section 1) and their related game theory concepts,
illustrating how understanding one can illuminate the other:
Game
Mechanic
Game Theory
Counterpart Connection and Example
Turn-Based
Sequential
Play
Sequential
Games &
Backward
Induction
Turn-based games (like Chess or Go) are sequential: players
move in turns, observing the current state. Game theory
models these with extensive form games and predicts
outcomes via backward induction (e.g. theoretically “solving”
chess by looking ahead to end states). In practice, players
use foresight (“if I do X, they’ll do Y…”) which mirrors
backward induction reasoning.
Simultaneous
Action
Selection
Simultaneous
(Normal-Form)
Games
When players choose actions simultaneously (e.g.
simultaneously revealing cards or orders), it’s a normal-form
game situation. Analysis involves finding Nash equilibria. 
Example:Rock-Paper-Scissors is effectively a simultaneous
zero-sum game with a mixed strategy equilibrium (each
choice 1/3 probability). Many simultaneous selection
mechanics (like blind bidding or secretly choosing a role) can
be analyzed as finding best responses to opponents’ mixed
strategies.
Bluffing /
Hidden
Information
Bayesian
Games
(Incomplete
Information)
Bluffing arises when some information is private – a hallmark
of incomplete-information games in game theory. Players
form beliefs and update them (Bayesian reasoning). Example:
Poker is a Bayesian game: each player knows their cards but
not others’. Bluffing in poker is essentially trying to alter
opponents’ beliefs about your hand. Game-theoretically, an
optimal bluff frequency can be computed so that your
opponents are indifferent to calling or folding (part of a
mixed-strategy equilibrium in poker). The concept of 
Bayesian Nash Equilibrium formalizes optimal strategies
when players have private information.

Auction
Theory;
Independent
Private Value
model
Auctions in games mirror economic auction models. Game
theory analyzes how bidders strategize based on their
valuation and others’ likely valuations. For instance, in a first-
price auction (common in many board games for turn order
or assets), the Nash equilibrium strategy is to bid below your
true value (bid shading) to avoid winner’s curse. In a
second-price auction (occasionally used in game variants),
bidding your true value is dominant. Understanding
these models helps players bid wisely. Game designers who
include auctions rely on auction theory results to predict
player behavior (e.g. ensuring a fair division or preventing
degenerate strategies).
Negotiation &
Trading
Cooperative
Game Theory /
Bargaining
When a game allows negotiation (trades, alliances), players
are engaging in free-form coalition building. Non-
cooperative game theory can model this via bargaining
games – e.g. the Nash Bargaining Solution predicts how
two parties might split a surplus if they can both agree. In
games like Settlers of Catan, trading resources has a flavor
of bargaining: if two players can mutually benefit by trade,
they must agree on an exchange rate. Coalition formation in
games like Diplomacy or Risk can be seen through
cooperative game theory concepts like the core or Shapley
value (what alliances form, and how the spoils of alliance are
divided). While most board games don’t enforce binding
agreements (making them technically non-cooperative
games), in-game negotiation is an exercise in forming
temporary cooperative strategies. Game theory teaches that
such agreements are only stable if each party is getting at
least as much as they would by going alone (their threat
point), which savvy players intuitively consider .
Hidden Roles /
Social
Deduction
Games of
Incomplete
Information;
Signaling
Hidden traitor or role mechanics (e.g. Secret Hitler, 
Werewolf) are essentially games of incomplete information.
The “good” players are trying to infer who the traitors are
(updating beliefs based on others’ actions – a Bayesian
process), while traitors may engage in signaling and
misrepresentation. Game theory’s signaling games study
how players with private types (e.g. loyalist vs. traitor) send
messages or take actions that might reveal (or conceal) their
type. A traitor lying effectively in a social deduction game is
like a Pool equilibrium in signaling: different types taking
similar actions to obfuscate identity. These mechanics
underscore concepts of information asymmetry and
strategic lying, which are central in economic game theory
models of markets with hidden information (e.g. Spence’s
job-market signaling model).

Cooperative
Gameplay
Identical
Payoff Games;
Coordination
Fully cooperative board games (like Pandemic) have players
sharing a common payoff (either everyone wins or loses
together). In game theoretic terms, this aligns incentives
completely – a trivial case of a game where any strategy
profile that maximizes the joint payoff is “best” for the group.
The challenge is not strategic between players (since there’s
no conflict) but rather an optimization against the game
system. However , if we consider the “game” to be players vs.
an imagined adversary, strategies involve coordination.
Even in co-op games, there can be coordination puzzles
analogous to stag hunts – e.g. “if we both focus on different
tasks, will we fail at both?” Players must assure each other to
commit to a joint plan (like both hunt the stag). Game
theory’s team games or coordination games provide
insight: communication greatly helps (hence many co-ops
allow table talk), and mechanisms like common knowledge of
intentions can ensure the best outcome (just as in pure
coordination games).
Alliances &
Betrayal
(Semi-Coop)
Prisoner’s
Dilemma &
Repeated
Games
Games where players can temporarily cooperate but
ultimately one wins (e.g. making a pact in Risk, or the 
Prisoner’s Dilemma style choice at the end of some games
to share victory or steal it) directly invoke game-theoretic
dilemmas. If two players ally to take down others, once that’s
done they face a classic endgame PD: betray for sole win or
stay allied for a joint win (if allowed). Many social games or
finales of reality TV shows use exactly this mechanic (notably
the game show “Golden Balls” ends with a prisoner’s
dilemma choice). Diplomacy ( ) is essentially a repeated
prisoner’s dilemma: you form alliances (cooperate) but can
backstab (defect) at any time; the shadow of future
interaction (knowing you’ll need trust in later turns) often
keeps alliances intact until the decisive moment. Game
theory tells us that if a game is finitely repeated with a clear
end, backward induction suggests betrayal at the end (as in
final-round prisoner’s dilemma defection). But in
practice, uncertainty about timing or reputation effects (or
emotional motives) allow cooperation to survive. Designers
use these insights to craft tense trust dynamics.

Direct Conflict
(Warfare,
“Take That”)
Zero-Sum and
Constant-Sum
Games
Mechanics that involve directly attacking or hindering others
(destroying units, stealing points) produce zero-sum-like
interactions. If a move hurts an opponent and
correspondingly improves your relative standing, the local
interaction is zero-sum even within a larger non-zero-sum
game. Game theory’s zero-sum model (utilizing minimax)
applies to sub-conflicts: e.g. tactical battles can be thought of
as mini zero-sum games where one player’s loss is another’s
gain in that skirmish. Understanding zero-sum reasoning can
improve play in combat games – e.g. in a two-player
fighting game (🎮 like Street Fighter), it’s pure zero-sum and
concepts like mixed strategies (randomizing moves to avoid
predictability) or dominance (never use a strictly worse
option) are directly relevant. In multiplayer games with “take
that” cards, while the overall game isn’t zero-sum (a third
party could benefit), any two-player confrontation might be
seen as zero-sum in the short run.
Randomness
& Risk
Uncertainty,
Mixed
Strategies,
Risk
Dominance
Random mechanics in games (dice, card draws) introduce 
exogenous uncertainty (chance). Game theory typically treats
the rules (including chance events) as part of the game
structure, not chosen by players – these are “moves by
nature.” However , randomness can also be seen as a mixing
strategy or as adding noise to outcomes. Players’ approach to
risk in games touches on decision theory (utility under
uncertainty). Also, games with randomness sometimes
mimic the need for mixed strategies: e.g. in Rock-Paper-
Scissors, players must randomize to avoid exploitation – that’s
essentially a player introducing their own unpredictability,
analogous to a die roll. Risk-reward mechanics (press-your-
luck) tie to concepts of expected value and risk dominance.
A strategy that is safer (less variance) vs. one that is riskier
but higher reward can be analyzed by expected payoff and
by players’ risk tolerance (in game theory, one might use
concepts from economics like risk-neutral vs risk-averse
utility). Players often use heuristic mini-maximization of
expected payoff when deciding whether to take an extra risk
in press-your-luck games.

Voting
Mechanics
Social Choice
Theory &
Voting Games
When games incorporate voting (e.g. deciding collectively
which rule to enact, or who gets expelled, etc.), they mirror
political science and social choice problems. Game theory
has models of voting games where players vote strategically
rather than sincerely if their preferences can be advanced by
doing so. Example: In Twilight Imperium ( ), players vote on
laws that can benefit some and hurt others. A player
might trade favors (“I’ll vote for your law if you support mine
later”) or vote against their preference if it’s already lost (to
curry favor). These behaviors correspond to coalition
formation and logrolling in voting theory. Concepts like 
Condorcet winners or agenda setting can be observed if a
game allows sequential voting on proposals. In essence,
whenever a game asks players to make a collective decision,
strategic voting (game-theoretic thinking) can emerge – such
as forming voting blocs or kingmaking (throwing support to
one side in exchange for something).
In summary, game mechanics and game theory are two sides of the same coin: mechanics define
the structure of choices and payoffs in a game, and game theory analyzes optimal play within that
structure.  For  players  and  designers,  understanding  the  link  can  be  very  fruitful.  A  designer
implementing  a  bluffing  mechanic can  anticipate  behaviors  using  game  theory’s  analysis  of
incomplete  information  games  –  for  instance,  ensuring  there’s  an  incentive  to  bluff  but  not  too
frequently, achieving a balance analogous to an equilibrium bluffing frequency. A player facing an
auction in a game can draw on auction theory to bid closer to optimally (avoiding the winner’s curse by
not overbidding beyond the item’s value). When mechanics create a prisoner’s dilemma situation – e.g.
two  players  could  cooperate  to  both  benefit,  but  each  has  temptation  to  betray  –  knowing  the
dilemma’s logic (and the possibility of repeated play fostering trust) can guide one’s strategy (or bluff
about being trustworthy).
Game theory can also inform game balance. For example, if a certain strategy strictly dominates others
(meaning it’s always better , a concept from game theory), the game mechanic offering the dominated
choices may need tweaking, or players will have no incentive to try those other choices (making the
game less interesting). Designers aim for no dominant strategies, instead preferring a  meta where
choices are situational (like in RPS, each choice can be countered). The concept of Nash equilibrium is
useful even informally – a well-balanced competitive game might allow an equilibrium where each
player’s strategy has counter-play but also counter-counter-play, etc., leading to a dynamic but fair
balance (often designers try to achieve something like a Nash equilibrium between character options or
strategies, so that there’s diversity in viable playstyles). 
Finally, it’s worth noting how real players vs. theoretical rational players can differ . Human players
have emotions, limited foresight, and heuristics. Game theory might predict that in the final round of a
repeated game, everyone defects (by backward induction), yet in reality players often cooperate
longer  than  theory  predicts,  either  out  of  error  or  because  humans  have  social  preferences  (like
retaliation or trust beyond pure payoff). Good game designs often leverage this: for instance, adding a
bit of uncertainty about when a game ends (like a random game end trigger in some board games) can
sustain cooperation – a known result from game theory is that if you don’t know exactly when the last
round is, mutual cooperation can persist. This kind of cross-pollination between theory and design
43

--- Page 16 ---
exemplifies the synergy between understanding game mechanics deeply and applying game theory
insights. Each informs the other: game theory provides a lens to predict what rational players might do
under certain mechanics, and observing players in actual games can in turn inspire new game-theoretic
models that account for bounded rationality, psychology, and creativity.
Conclusion: Game mechanics are the toolkit with which designers build engaging challenges, and
game theory is the analytical framework that explains the strategic essence of those challenges. For an
enthusiast, studying game mechanics gives a vocabulary for how games work, while studying game
theory  provides  a  vocabulary  for  why  players  make  certain  choices.  Together ,  they  enrich  our
understanding of games – whether it’s designing a balanced board game, playing a video game at a
high level, or even understanding real-world strategic situations (many of which can be surprisingly
game-like). As one author eloquently put it,  “those wood and plastic pieces [of board games] aren’t just
rules – they’re game theory”. Every time we play a game and devise a cunning strategy or adapt to an
opponent, we are implicitly “practicing game theory”. And conversely, every well-crafted game is,
under the hood, an embodiment of strategic interactions that game theory seeks to characterize. By
lifting the hood – studying both mechanics and theory – we gain a deeper appreciation for the brilliance
of games and the logic of strategy that binds them to real life.
